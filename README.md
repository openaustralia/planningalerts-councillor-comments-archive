# planningalerts-councillor-comments-archive

Archive of comments made to councillors on https://www.planningalerts.org.au

This is an archive of publically visible comments made to councillors on
PlanningAlerts roughly between 2016 and 2019.

The data is exported in the YAML format with only publically visible information
included. We've also include councillor information and any replies from
the councillors.

The ability to send comments to councillors was disabled in 2019 because the
overhead of maintaining an up-to-date list of all the councillors for many,
many councils including their details and images proved to be far too difficult
a task to do well.

Also, some core bits of technology, most importantly WriteIt was discontinued
and so pretty big changes would have needed to be made to get it all working
properly again.

If we rebuild / recreate this feature in the future we will likely have to
focus earlier on on finding a sustainable way for the councillor information
to be kept up to-date. One passing idea is to only add councillors to a
particular local council if a small group of local people nominate themselves
as maintainers of the data for their council. They are the people most
motivated to keep things up to date. Of course we don't really know if that
would work in practise but it might be one place to start in the future.
