    text: I'm not entirely sure how the planning system works.  After being given
      approval for the development, recently a variation was requested removing an
      entire floor of car parking - I imagine these cars will now have to park on
      the street.  And now the application to remove these significant trees.  It
      was obvious from the originally application showing building right to the street
      that the trees would not be retained.  Why was this not addressed at the time,
      and the developers sent back to the drawing board to come up with a design that
      maintained the existing tree cover?

        Thanks Sylvia,

                    Very distressing…… will continue until the State government allows us to have mandatory laws in Unley requiring a minimum of 15% tree cover and deep soil zoned.

        easily. The trees should be dealt with on an individual basis and only removed,

        Thank you for your email.
        Moreton Bay Road is a state government and regardless of the ownership, council does not have the authority to enforce red light infringements.

        Agree with Amy Glade on all counts especially the roads and accidents. WHEN are red light cameras going to be installed on the intersection Mt Cotton and Moreton Bay Roads near Aldi?

        I travel that road most peak days and drivers rushing carelessly is abhorrent. Just a matter if time... Guaranteed god revenue for Government and hopefully save a few lives to boot.

        such this application is certain to be refused, and so it will not come to

        was lodged. My best guess is that the owner is seeking to reduce the value
        of the land to $1 in order to avoid paying land tax. This issue was covered
        in the local press recently, and the only difference between this application
        and the other examples to date is that this application seeks to trigger S2(9)
        of the Valuation Of Land Act 1960 rather than S2(8).\n\nArticle:\nhttps://cbdnews.com.au/heritage-owners-exploit-tax-loophole/\n\nThe
        applicant is well within their rights to lodge this application and I suggest
        no illegality on their part.\n\nBut rest assured that the building is not

    text: Couldnt agree more Keith Goodman. We are located over opposite side and
      what was once land, council allowed leggo land housing to go in followed by
      and industrial area consiting of fire station, kangaroo bus lines and a great
      big truck sales and service centre with illuminating truck signs at night and
      day, all view points from our home now is KENWORTH truck signs pointing straight
      in our direction in north shore estate. Not to mention constant security alarms
      going off, noise of them working 24/7, hearing people being called on PA system.
      Ive written numerous times to this council over the signs and this industrial
      area and stressed the signs should not be facing towards residential area and
      buffer such as trees need to put up and was told no its flood land, yet council
      allowed small homes and industrial area to be built there. Its disgraceful.
      One must also mention how over built our area is becoming with infastructure
      not able to cope. Back to your comment of homes next to industrial, what council
      have allowed here is disgraceful. With the area beside this industrial place
      zoned for more industrial buildings, which will see us surrounded by industry
      and severely impacting the value of our home. Nothing more pleasant than hosting
      a bbq outside, standing in kitchen, taking a swim in our pool and opening our
      blinds in our bedroom to see great big truck signs glaring at us. Your decision
      peter flannery to allow industrial areas to be built beside residential areas
      and vice versa is very questionable!

    text: I think that this development proposal is manifestly excessive in every
      way- way too high and large for the area, does not take into consideration neighbouring
      properties and the negative visual, noise and traffic impact on them, and has
      not taken any consideration into the capacity of the existing roads and infrastructure
      to cope with such a multi-level city style development. I object strongly to
      any attempt to turn the peninsula into a pseudo Gold Coast, where there is no
      parking, no sunlight for many properties or streets unless it is midday, and
      the laid back lifestyle of the area is obliterated. There are  enough high-rises
      in the area already.  I say NO!

        Hi Jeffrey,
        Thanks very much for your email.
        This problem is very much on Council's mind as well. All care is provided by private enterprise so what Council has done is to provide incentives for them to build more care facilities in our area. Unfortunately they always look at the economics of the situation before they build.
        At present we only have Anam Cara and Pinewoods in the central Pine area to cope with the ever increasing number of older Aussies of which I am growing closer to every year.
        I would dearly love to see another one or two facilities in this area as you are correct, most of our elderly have to move outside the area.
        The incentives I spoke of were an amount of $10M to developers to build either high rise or retirement type facilities in areas where council deemed we needed them. There was only one application for a retirement home unfortunately.
        We still have money in the incentives budget should anyone come along. Hopefully they will.
        An excellent spot would be the land down behind Westfields at Strathpine.
        I live in hope.
        Best wishes,
        Mick

      enough without the extra residents in the street. There already is insufficient
      parking for kids drop off at the local St Simons school with cars looking for
      parking on Taylors Lane even further at times than this property. Further, development
      will only decrease the value of properties rather than increase and nobody wants
      these double storey houses built on tiny blocks where everybody can hear each
      other. Not a good move!

      or the people that do end up renting them do not stay for very long at all.
      This knock-down and others like it are destroying the area beyond repair.\r\nNot
      only do I wish to protest this proposed build, but I would very much like to
      protest the tearing down of this beautiful residence to begin with. It's a stunning
      home much beloved by its current renters and by the old owners, and if it were
      put up for sale again (not to developers) it would become a cherished family
      home once more. I would much rather see families moving into the area than have
      it turned into an empty area with no inhabitants and no soul.\r\nIs there any
      way to prevent it being torn down? Tearing it down is not sound environmentally,
      will be incredibly disruptive to the neighbours and the quality of the street,
      and will be replaced by poorly designed tear-downs in their own right."

    text: We agree entirely with Emma Miller.  Developers and corporate land owners
      are constantly targeting trees they erroneously propose as dangerous or inappropriate
      when, in fact when inspected, it is obvious the trees are not dangerous and,
      to the contrary, provide green cover, shade and amenity to the property and
      Greenhill Road streetscape.  It is unconscionable that applications to remove
      healthy green cover such as 163a/164 Greenhill Rd persist for their own selfish
      reasons when there remains a local community who are directly ignored and, as
      a consequence, de-valued.

        Thanks Sylvia,

                        Couldn’t agree More. Hopefully we are doing a DPA at the request of a developer who verbally stated that they are happy to have the mandatory 15% tree cover with deep root zone in the rules for the property!



                        Also had great noises back from State Cabinet about a 15% rule for Unley as a test case. Some way to travel so I am also sending this to our planning staff.


        With my best wishes,
                          Michael

      of trees have recently been sacrificed for the convenience of developers on
      another greenhill road building site (on the east side Joslin street corner).
      If we keep letting this happen, the ‘leafy’ suburbs are going to be completely
      denuded and changed forever. Why does this regulated tree need to be removed.
      How does this count as community consultation?

      text: Hi, this has been applied for under Section 54A of the act that regulates
        the removal of trees. Council can not control who applies to remove tree or
        when they choose to do so. However, the do  choose, within the bounds of the
        Act, if they can be legally removed or not. The Act allows for any tree, other
        than a eucalypt, to be removed if they are closer than 10m to a building of
        value, if they are causing significant damage to a building or if the tree
        is deemed to be unsafe. Unfortunately, this is deemed by the state government
        and not council. Regards, Jennie

      gave her all planning alerts details and have never heard a word since. This
      was a fortnight after the election. John Pesutto was supportive and attended
      council planning meetings regularly. In fact he was part of our team that won
      a heritage overlay battle in our neighborhood. I grew up in Kew and have lived

    text: "I totally agree with all the points made in the previous objections.  This
      is not what our local area needs - nor the wider Redcliffe community.  We are
      surrounded by servos already. \r\n\r\nThe community will be disadvantaged and
      suffer a loss of lifestyle and amenity if a service station is built in this
      location.  Here are 5 good reasons why:  \r\n\r\n1)  Pollution of all types
      will increase - noise pollution, air pollution and light pollution.\r\n\r\n2)
      \ We are very concerned that weekend noise will increase and disturb the peace
      of the neighbourhood on Sundays and public holidays.  To loose the peace and
      sanctity of our homes like this will be a significant loss of liveability for
      local residents.\r\n\r\n3)  Another primary concern is that these facilities
      are a target for crime on a fairly regular basis.  Obviously this is very undesirable
      for us living in adjacent areas.  The obvious exit strategy would be up the
      hill into our area from where you can access Victoria, McDonald and Duffield
      Roads with less likelihood of detection.  This potentially brings crime into
      our streets. \r\n\r\n4)  Margate has a high density of medical providers.  Is
      it safe for pedestrians to place a service station, with cars turning out of
      fast traffic, in the midst of this?\r\n\r\n5)  Further to this, as Dover Road
      residents we have also noticed litter from cars has decreased markedly since
      KFR moved.  If this goes ahead we anticipate litter will increase again as people
      turn up the hill via Boyce, Ewan and Hale Streets and throw litter from their
      cars.  \r\n\r\nWhilst it's understandable for different business models to be
      proposed for Margate as \r\nthe area developments, not all proposals will be
      suitable or beneficial.  Clearly the negatives of this proposal far outweigh
      any benefits.  \r\n\r\nFor all the good reasons that have been given by the
      community in general - this project needs to be rejected."

      \ Children use these streets to walk to and from school, yes they shouldn't
      walk on the road but they do.  The opening hours are ridiculous,  the additional
      noise and pollution this business will generate will ensure complaints to MBRC

      spend so much time and effort and money attempting to educate the public about

      I highly doubt that they will employ residents of the Peninsular, shouldn't
      \ this be priority.  Finally, the Convenience store that is 79m is away a constant
      target for armed robberies, one occurring this week with the attending being
      transported to hospital with a fractured arm.  Do we need another target for

      text: "Good afternoon Damian,\n\nCouncil is receipt of your emailed concerns
        to Councillor Lutton regarding the approved development upon 32 Berzins Court
        potentially spreading of fire ants.\n\nCouncil engineering and Construction
        Taskforce officers on Monday this week met with the developers and contractors
        on this property and undertook a ‘pre start meeting’ associated with the approved
        engineering plans to develop this property.\n\nI can confirm that at this
        time qualified consultants were undertaking a flora and fauna survey of the
        premises which includes a coordinated fire ant inspection.\n\nThe contractors
        have a standard operating procedure relating to fire ant management approved
        by Biosecurity Queensland which is brought into effect upon the locating of
        a nest.\n\nWe have on the basis of your reported concerns, referred this matter
        to Biosecurity Queensland who may look into this smatter also.\n\nConstruction
        Taskforce officers and engineering officers will be proactively monitoring
        the site throughout the works driving quality development practices.\n\nShould
        you have further inquiry regarding this matter, please contact me directly

    text: "A recent survey showed local residents are overwhelmingly opposed to plans
      for a 13 storey building on the corner of Coate Avenue. Should the application
      be approved, it will:  \r\n1. Create a building with a height and housing density
      totally inappropriate for a quiet suburban street and until recently a serene
      urban environment.   \r\n2. Cast a permanent shadow over homes that surround
      the development. \r\n3. Double the number of cars in a street that is already
      not coping with the demand for car parking. \r\n4. Place even greater strain

    text: I have been watching the planning alerts locally for some time now and am
      shocked that eleven dwellings in one development could be allowed .  The only
      rationale is that council wants development at all cost.  Is it to earn income
      for council or is it due to developers having undue influence on councillors
      or workers at council?  What other reasons could there be to carve up this land
      in the mannner that it is being done.  What are the developers giving back to
      the suburb in return.  The designs are boring and outdated.  They don't appear
      to be sustainable and in ten years will look awful as they are cheaply built
      for a quick buck.  In a development as big as this the developer should at least
      be made to set aside a large area for the residents to have green space and
      to grow vegetables, etc.   Obviously, no one at council lives in this area or
      cares what happens....

    text: As residents of Point Leo located at 30 Nobby Street we are located 750m
      away from the proposed helipad. Point Leo is unique on the Mornington Peninsula
      for its lack of noise pollution. Water powercraft are unable to launch at Point
      Leo and as such the community is able to enjoy peaceful and quiet enjoyment
      of our beautiful location. Like powered watercraft, the proposed helipad and
      associated noise associated with helicopters landing and taking off would seriously
      impact on the overall amenity and attractiveness of this destination. Further
      the proposed location is on the uphill side of the Point Leo community and as
      such would exacerbate the impact of both the aural and visual disturbance associated
      with helicopters both landing and taking off. This helipad is also setting a
      precedent for the area that is unwelcome by the Pt Leo community and unwarranted.
      The helipad is an entirely discretionary request so on the grounds noted above
      we strongly object to this application being approved

    text: "I am concerned about the HEIGHT of buildings, residential or otherwise,
      being built on Bribie Island and Its surrounds. Bribie Island has been a place
      of peace and quite, where you can escape other places such as Cities, The Gold
      Coast, The Sunshine Coast, Redcliffe etc., where buildings dominate the skyline
      and motor vehicle fumes fill the air.\r\n\r\nWhy is anyone allowed to put in
      a Development Application to be considered, even if, in building it, it requires
      to go outside of the already stated rules & regulations? It is my understanding
      that the public are welcome to put in submissions against the proposal, if in
      fact they see the sign in front of the proposed building site and have the time
      & means of continually writing submissions in the hope that the rules and their
      wishes be met. Shouldn't it be the other way around? That the developer has
      to get the majority of the rate payers and residents to agree in writing with
      the changes they are making?\r\n\r\nI am also concerned about infrastructure
      for future development on Bribie Island, there are already signs of pressure
      on roads, the bridge etc. leading onto and off of the island. We came to live
      on an Island and do not want it to turn into an over crowded and polluted City."

    text: "I fully support the views of the Buchanan’s. Having lived on the Gold Coast
      and experienced the horrendous traffic issues and frenetic pace, I strongly
      oppose any developers’ proposals to build high rise units on Bribie. The infrastructure
      is already struggling to cope with the current increasing population on Bribie.
      If this application is approved, where does it stop? \r\nLook at the impact
      of QM development on the Golf Course precinct and Pacific Harbour. The congested
      living, the traffic congestion and the impact on our wildlife in the area. \r\nThese
      types of development submissions need to be made public to allow concerned residents
      who want to retain the unique living environment, to voice their views against
      such developments. \r\n"

    text: "Colin Buchanan\r\nMy wife's thoughts mirror my own. We moved to Bribie
      because it wasn't the Gold or Sunshine coast.  The traffic problems since the
      Sandstone Point hotel opened were bad enough, an hour to get home from Morayfield
      on a Saturday frustrating at best. And with the multi story box on the first
      roundabout almost complete I cannot help but wonder what's it going to be like,
      when the extra folk that live in it try to get onto an already poorly thought
      out intersection. To 233 Welsby and another box being plonked there to add to
      traffic woes while it's being built and beyond.  Every time I drove back home
      over the bridge I used to say a quiet thank you as I surveyed the island, now
      I have one eyesore before I've traveled 100 metres, and will soon have another
      before I even get off the bridge. And I can only imagine the back room deals
      that went on before the 5 story box got approval in Foley street.  What's next
      a casino?\r\nAnd not happy with the regular fireworks displays stressing wildlife,
      our council seems to have forgotten to get developers to fence the border to
      the National park where it meets housing estates.\r\nSeems chasing the holy
      dollar is more important.\r\n\r\n "

      fence will offer anywhere near the sound protection of the brick house and garage

      going to assume it will stop everything - dust, chemical drift - because I believe
      it won't. And given the number of times over the years this property has been

      too and want it to stay that way.   The application is to provide some additional
      space to our existing home, so that our young family can stay in this great
      area long term. We will be keeping a healthy-sized backyard (at least by Kensington
      standards!) so there should be plenty of room on site for builders to do their
      thing without too much disturbance to the neighbourhood.  \r\n\r\nTotally understand
      the concerns about noise outside of the work site times, and we would hate to
      think our reno has been a headache for our neighbours.   If you'd like to know

        for our young ones looking to earn a bit of extra dollars.\n\n\nBelow is the
        response I received from councils Development /Planning section based on my
        request for further information in relation to what the owner has to comply
        with or is restricted to in relation to the extension  of the centre.\nIt
        is important to note there is no development application as such and in fact
        is classed as a self-assessable material change of use which only needs a
        building certifier to approve,\nCouncil has no ability to refuse the proposed
        change of use.\n\n\nChild Care Centre at 1-13 Forestdale Drive\n\n  *   There
        is an existing development approval for a Child Care Centre at 1-13 Forestdale
        Drive Forestdale.\n  *   This development approval was issued on 28 September
        2016 and approved a Child Care Centre in the southern portion of the Shopping
        centre site with a capacity for 50 children.\n  *   This development application
        was Code Assessable under the Logan Planning Scheme 2015 (meaning no public
        notification is required), as a Child Care Centre is an intended use that’s
        allowed in the Neighbourhood Centre zoning that applies to the shopping centre
        site. A development application was only required as the proposal included
        a new building area.\n  *   Details of the development application and approval
        are available on Council’s website - below is a link to the application materials:-\nhttp://pdonline.logan.qld.gov.au/MasterViewUI/Modules/ApplicationMaster/default.aspx?page=wrapper&key=1909617\n\nCurrent
        extension\n\n  *   It is important to note that no development application
        is required for the current extension.\n  *   The information on the planning
        alerts website relates to a building application by a private building certifier
        ( reference BW-1804/2019). This is a building application under the Building
        Act 1975 and National Construction Code (formerly known as the Building Code
        of Australia). There is no development application or development approval
        for the extension.\n  *   A Child Care Centre is Accepted Development (meaning
        no development application is required) in the Neighbourhood Centre zoning
        that applies to the shopping centre site, if it involves the use existing
        buildings.\nAs the Child Care Centre extension will be occurring in the existing
        shopping centre building, no development application will be required provided

        at Forestdale Shopping Centre 1-13 Forestdale Drive Forestdale QLD 4118\n\nThis
        is not good for our Forestdale community. A community until 2018 had a coffee
        shop, and bakery where residents were able to to meet up and enjoy a chat
        over coffee. Where residents could run into the bakery/convenience store for
        milk or bread rather than driving down to Browns Plains. As many residents
        have stated “our hub”.\n\nI appose the idea of the childcare centre expanding
        where it requires to reach out further afield and bring in children from other
        suburbs to fill quotas. Johnson road is already heavily congested and this
        will only add to a traffic nuisance morning and afternoons. I attended the
        initial meetings where the owner of the childcare centre stated he would work
        with our community...this application defies this. Forestdale is our community
        and we would like to see our shops back. It is a no from me.\n\nForestdale

    text: "Good evening Councillor,\r\nThis is very disappointing to see this application
      for change of use for this property. On Monday 05 June 2017, the owner of the
      property advised residents at a NHW meeting that there would be six shops at
      the shopping village when renovations were completed including an outdoor alfresco
      area. Since this time, all tenants excluding one have vacated the premises due
      to inflated rental prices, beyond reasonable even with the renovations and new
      fascade of the property and other personal reasons. \r\nUpon many verbal discussions
      with the owner of the property, he has assured the community that he was very
      keen to rebuild the shopping village and wanted to be an integral component
      of the community and work with everyone. However, as advised by many, the owner
      has failed to return phone calls, emails and other correspondence pertaining
      to the letting of shops for vendors. He has also failed to return calls, follow
      through on verbal commitments for community support and has made it very clear
      that the community and the value that he claimed to hold for Forestdale, is
      no longer present. \r\nThe child care centre itself was of concern to many in
      the area when it was first planned, however, the community has now supported
      and welcomed the centre and has invited them to be involved on a number of occasions
      with community events and meetings, with attendance only once since opening
      at a community event. \r\nTo reaffirm, I find it very disappointing to see that
      the owner has failed to consult the community at all on this planned change
      to our vital community hub and has somewhat attempted to blindside the community
      through this application.\r\nI believe, alongside many others, that this application
      should be denied in line with the fact that there have been willing tenants
      for shops at the premises, however, the owner obviously has other plans for
      the centre and therefore, has neglected to fulfil requests for these tenants
      to obtain leases. \r\nWe would welcome any information to be shared with the
      community about this further through the NHW which is an integral part of the
      community and can be contacted at info@forestdale.com.au\r\nKind Regards,\r\nJocelyn
      Marentis\r\nArea Coordinator\r\nForestdale Neighbourhood Watch Inc.\r\n"

    text: "A critical factor in achieving community and council support for the original
      daycare development was the undertaking given by the new owner to support the
      community and existing businesses. This was overtly articulated during community
      consultation and NW meetings. Plans provided clearly display the full occupancy
      of the complex of shops at that time (i.e. \"Existing Bakery, Medical Centre,
      Cafe, Hair and Beauty Salon, and Personal Training\"). This was demonstrably
      achievable, as recently as 2016.\r\n\r\nDespite appeals from the community to
      preserve this historically treasured \"hub\", actions were reportedly taken
      by the new owner which affected the viability of these existing small businesses.
      Vacancies rapidly followed. Morale of residents was notably affected. Subsequently,
      the community has become aware of multiple approaches, often by locals, with
      interest in reestablishing the block of shops. It would appear that there has
      been no genuine appetite to 'meet the current market' to enable this?\r\n\r\nAnd
      now, this planning application represents an attempt to remove the last vestiges
      of community infrastructure available to Forestdale as a whole. Expansion of
      a daycare centre not yet even at capacity, primarily to benefit commuters and
      profit for the owner (of this and multiple other centers). But nowhere remaining
      for the locals to even buy a loaf of bread or milk, let alone meet socially,
      without getting into cars and leaving the suburb.\r\n\r\nDespite paying one
      of the highest Council rates in the region, Forestdale has no sewerage, no public
      transport service and very limited mobile coverage. It remains in limbo regarding
      a major freight route to pass within metres of homes. In my opinion, removing
      this small retail precinct cannot fail to further affect property values and
      negatively impact the quality of life of residents. I strongly believe that
      it is the responsibility of Council, in assessing the merits of this application,
      to appropriately weigh these ramifications and protect constituents"

        at Forestdale Shopping Centre 1-13 Forestdale Drive Forestdale QLD 4118\n\nA
        critical factor in achieving community and council support for the original
        daycare development was the undertaking given by the new owner to support
        the community and existing businesses. This was overtly articulated during
        community consultation and NW meetings. Plans provided clearly display the
        full occupancy of the complex of shops at that time (i.e. \"Existing Bakery,
        Medical Centre, Cafe, Hair and Beauty Salon, and Personal Training\"). This
        was demonstrably achievable, as recently as 2016.\n\nDespite appeals from
        the community to preserve this historically treasured \"hub\", actions were
        reportedly taken by the new owner which affected the viability of these existing
        small businesses. Vacancies rapidly followed. Morale of residents was notably
        affected. Subsequently, the community has become aware of multiple approaches,
        often by locals, with interest in reestablishing the block of shops. It would
        appear that there has been no genuine appetite to 'meet the current market'
        to enable this?\n\nAnd now, this planning application represents an attempt
        to remove the last vestiges of community infrastructure available to Forestdale
        as a whole. Expansion of a daycare centre not yet even at capacity, primarily
        to benefit commuters and profit for the owner (of this and multiple other
        centers). But nowhere remaining for the locals to even buy a loaf of bread
        or milk, let alone meet socially, without getting into cars and leaving the
        suburb.\n\nDespite paying one of the highest Council rates in the region,
        Forestdale has no sewerage, no public transport service and very limited mobile
        coverage. It remains in limbo regarding a major freight route to pass within
        metres of homes. In my opinion, removing this small retail precinct cannot
        fail to further affect property values and negatively impact the quality of
        life of residents. I strongly believe that it is the responsibility of Council,
        in assessing the merits of this application, to appropriately weigh these
        ramifications and protect constituents\n\nFrom A. Floyd-Smith to local councillor

    text: 'Having moved to Forestdale in 2018 for the lifestyle of space and community
      we are bitterly disappointed at this application to change the shops into offices.
      It’s truly a sad sad day as we have waited for shops to open and then this!
      The only reason the shops have remained vacant is due to the rent being too
      high considerably higher than it was previously when the shops were tenanted.
      I believe this change would be a blow to the commmunity as there is no hub for
      us to meet and all Forestdale residents would support shops if they were able
      to establish themselves and afford the lease. This application is incredibly
      upsetting and should be dismissed, the lease rates assessed as I believe they
      are inflated to make sure no shop owners are able to afford to establish a business
      here therefore the lessor can do what he likes. Disgraceful. Money over people
      basically.  '

    text: Forestdale is a community which is no longer serviced by public transport,
      has an active NHW and Facebook community, but sadly lacks a meeting place or
      a corner store with our closest shopping centre over 4km away. It is a travesty
      that enquirers have been given the run around and exorbitant rental prices clearly
      quoted in order to keep the "Forestdale Shopping Centre" vacant so that the
      child care centre can expand at the expense of other standard community services.
      At a time when there is so much disconnection among people, it is doubly disappointing
      that we are not able to have some basic conveniences at the entry to our suburb.

        application at Forestdale Shopping Centre 1-13 Forestdale Drive Forestdale
        QLD 4118\n\nForestdale is a community which is no longer serviced by public
        transport, has an active NHW and Facebook community, but sadly lacks a meeting
        place or a corner store with our closest shopping centre over 4km away. It
        is a travesty that enquirers have been given the run around and exorbitant
        rental prices clearly quoted in order to keep the \"Forestdale Shopping Centre\"
        vacant so that the child care centre can expand at the expense of other standard
        community services. At a time when there is so much disconnection among people,
        it is doubly disappointing that we are not able to have some basic conveniences
        at the entry to our suburb.\n\nFrom Ruth Christensen to local councillor Laurie

    text: "I wish to record my objection to the construction and placement of a billboard
      as proposed on Boardman Road on or adjacent to the Fire & Rescue Station. \r\n\r\nSuch
      a decision may cause an accident in the future when an emergency arises which
      requires the prompt action of the fire services, as there will be a conflict
      of attention between the billboard and the strobe lighting etc of an emergency
      vehicle. It would appear irresponsible to me to place a distraction adjacent
      to an emergency service. \r\n\r\nWhen an emergency arises, you want as little
      distraction as possible to impede the progress of a vehicle leaving the site.
      This need is in direct competition with the placing of a billboard in a position
      to maximise its visibility and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nIf you move the billboard
      further down Boardman Road, you will be making what is now a visually appealing
      grove of trees, into an eyesore.\r\n\r\nSurely the very fact that Klingner (now
      two lanes each way) was upgraded to increase road traffic and make Boardman
      (reducing to a single lane where the billboard is proposed), therefore a lower
      priority road would, suggest that Klingner is a better site for such a billboard.\r\n"

      what’s happening in this state or community, or if they are advertising a business,
      their purpose is to get people’s attention. To distract them enough to pass
      on that message. It is stupidity to try and get the drivers’ attention off this
      section of road, especially where the road narrows, the road bends and at night
      the surroundings are darker and animals run out on the street. Not to mention
      that it is a beautiful bit of landscaping leading into a wonderful suburb to
      live. Would this sign also detract from the emergency lights at the fire station.
      Would the lit signs be in line of sight of the flashing lights indicating a
      firetruck is exiting the station? This sign is not necessary, nor needed.

      being only 50mm from the road frontage instead of 1m.  Secondly, the area is
      predominantly residential and would be a considerable source of light pollution
      and would distract from the general amenity of the area.  Thirdly, the sign
      would be a further distraction for drivers when there is already problems with
      traffic merging into one lane heading towards the Griffith Road Roundabout.

      of trees lining this \"entry way\" into Newport has really come into it's own
      in the last few years. It is an asset to our suburb and a valuable green space.\r\nTo
      have it violated by a garish lit billboard - positioned to best  intrude on
      the focus and concentration of the drivers on the increasingly congested Boardman
      Road will not only be a aesthetic insult, but a safety hazard as well. It will
      be a source of light pollution, in an area frequented by nocturnal native animals.
      This is essentially a residential area and an ugly commercial sign is not needed

    text: As a long term resident of Newport, i have experienced the increase of traffic
      in the Newport area since Stocklands development has taken place.  this is only
      going to get worse once residents move in.   The need for a billboard in this
      position will add distraction to the already over congested road.  I dont believe
      it is in the best interests of the public to position such billboard in this
      location.  It could also be a nuisance to the surrounding neighboring houses,
      visual impact and if it is illuminated, then the 24/7 lights will also impede
      on neighboring privacy and their environment.

    text: I wish to strongly object to this proposal for two 6m x 3m illuminated billboards
      on Boardman Road at the fire station.  This is a totally unnecessary source
      of visual and light pollution and driver distraction.  I consider that the location
      is poor because it is in a residential area, and also on a bend on a very busy
      road that has a change of grade - and emergency vehicle access - near that point.  Traffic
      safety must come first, and distracted drivers cause accidents.  This site is
      a key entrance and exit to Newport and Scarborough (which is no doubt why the
      DA has selected it).  The amenity of this locality is a welcoming gateway to
      these areas, which is why the original Newport developers planted the avenue
      of trees here.  Newport and Scarborough are free from advertising (apart from
      temporary advertising of the Stockland Newport developers) at present, and I
      strongly oppose any proposal to commercialise our residential area with billboards.

    text: "Councillr Houghton,\r\nI firmly disagree with the proposed sign outsde
      the fire station on Boardman Rd, its physical size, and what is proposed will
      cause distraction and reduce visual amenity of what is a residential area, with
      a very pretty landscaped tree lined roadway.\r\nThe narrowing of the road Northbound,
      from two lanes, into one lane, gives drivers enough to focus on, and a large
      sign, such as this, will be a distraction.\r\nFurther, once one is allowed,
      in a residential area, then we open the gates for further visual signs such
      as ths, amongst ourstreets.\r\nThank you,\r\nJ Lea"

    text: There is already a problem with the volume of traffic down this road with
      the new Stockland development and its lack of infrastructure in and out of this
      area. The planned signage is in an area where the road converes from two to
      one lane, we do not need another distraction on an already hazardous area. I
      would vote no to this signage.

      by council. Our precious area is buckling under the strain and our infrastructure
      cannot cope with the influx and huge addition to our population.  It has just

      has doubled!!  We have four 3 bedroom townhouses that has not had adequate car
      accommodation since it was built. Difficult for the tenants to get in and out
      of their garages, so most of them park in the street.  I notice in the DA that
      it refers to \"two lane bitumen access off Walton Street\".  If someone parks
      on one side of the street and another car, or god forbid a small truck is parked

      traffic flow and resulting congestion need to be carefully considered.

      Park. \r\nMy objects are on the basis of:\r\n1.  The address for this development
      is misleading as there is no access to this development from Holloway Rd so
      should not be identified as a Wonga Park postcode.\r\n2.  The location is clearly
      in the Chirnside Park (Chirnside Village) area so the development should be
      accurately labeled.\r\n3.  The additional 40+ houses would only be able to access
      their properties by Regency Rise or meadowbank ave. Regenct Rise already is
      a  congested thoroughfare.  It would not be able to manage an additional 80+
      cars per day. This is dangerous to have that number of additional vehicles navigating
      moving around parked cars  these are narrow streets that could not manage the
      additional traffic.\r\n4. The additional traffic would significantly reduce
      the peaceful amenity of the area..\r\n5. The wetlands, creek, bird life and
      other wild life and important green space adds to the mental wellbeing of the
      local residents. This development will directly impact on the residents wellbeing.\r\n\r\nI
      urge the council to deny building permission for this development and retain

      is that at least the front of the house cannot be demolished as it will change
      the facade.  The whole house is now demolished with front garden tree removed.  When
      the new dwelling is constructed, it had better look the same from the street.  If
      the street facade has now changed I will be livid.

        AM\nTo: Jolly, Stephen Cr\nSubject: Planning application at 64 The Esplanade
        Clifton Hill VIC 3068\n\nI wonder why I wasn't notified before planning approval
        was given.  I live 3 doors away.  I am unable to find the plans online.  I
        live in a heritage overlay area.  The new building is 2 stories, where the
        previous was 1.  My understanding is that at least the front of the house
        cannot be demolished as it will change the facade.  The whole house is now
        demolished with front garden tree removed.  When the new dwelling is constructed,
        it had better look the same from the street.  If the street facade has now
        changed I will be livid.\n\nFrom Nick Merrylees to local councillor Stephen
        Jolly\n\n=========================================================================\n\nNick
        Merrylees posted this message to you on PlanningAlerts in response to the
        following planning application.\n\nYour reply, and any other response to this
        email, will be sent to Nick Merrylees and posted on the PlanningAlerts website

      text: "Dear Claire,\n\nThanks for your email.  I will ask Officers to formally
        respond to your two questions, as I am a Councillor, and can respond from
        that perspective but given urban planning is quite complex and detailed, I'd
        like to ensure you get an authoritative professional response too.\n\nMy responses
        to your two queries are below:\n\n1) What is the process for which developers
        can ignore the height control?\nhttp://services.land.vic.gov.au/maps/pmo.jsp\n\nMoreland
        City Council has sought, more than once, to have the Vic Planning Minister
        to approve height limits, but the Minister has not approved these, thus the
        preferred heights are the guide to developers and Planning Officers.\n\nMany
        developers/proponents do often seek to build something beyond the preferred
        heights. In some cases officers, under delegation may approve an application
        above the preferred heights, but usually refer these to the PARM - Planning
        and Related Matters Committee of MCC. This gives Councillors the role of deciding,
        with officer advice, on the application.\n\nI cannot say for certain, but
        the pattern has been, in the past two years of my time as a Councillor, that
        the PARM may approve a proposal above the preferred heights, but only when
        the other features of the development have high standards and outcomes. These
        may include aspects such as, high Environmental Sustainable Design (ESD) proivisions
        (high thermal ratings, solar passive design, water capture use/re-use, accessibility
        and visitiabliity, internal amenity and so on ...)\n\nWithout specific height
        limits, we are not able to maintain an absolute height in any of our planning
        zones.\n\n2) Is Moreland Council committed to the height control rule?\n\nRe
        the street width and street wall height, when one stands on the street opposite
        the proposed building, one should not necessarily be able to see the top of
        the building, only the 3 or 4th level (referred to as the street wall height).
        There are other technical terms and principles that come into play but these
        are some of the major/common features that are considered by Planners when
        they assess proposals under Victoria's Planning system.\n\nI refer to this
        type of system, the Vic planning system, as a 'post modern' system. That is,
        there very few absolutes in the scheme, and hundreds of variables which can
        be adjusted and moved depending upon the other variables proposed.\n\nI hope
        the officers can explain this better than my attempts above Claire.\n\nFinally,
        just to alert you to the fact that, Moreland City Council does not rely upon
        the Planning Alerts system to communicate with our residents, as it is controlled
        by a third party.  I would encourage you to use Council's online, public tools
        and access points. These are on the MCC website.\n\nThanks for taking the
        time to get in touch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCr Mark Riley\nSouth Ward I Moreland

    text: "Dear Mark,\r\n\r\nI work full time, so was unable to attend the council
      meeting last week. I object to 22 Black St proposal - it's TOO HIGH and exceeds
      the 19M height control.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded:\r\n\r\n- You have already
      approved four towers in the Jewell area, which gave no regard to the physical
      context of the low scale, single storey Victorian terraces that have a heritage
      overlay. The heritage overlay means these terraces are unlikely to experience
      any significant redevelopment.\r\n\r\n- Many residents have lived in these terraces
      well before the commercial zoning and heritage overlay was applied, so it’s
      unreasonable to expect residents should’ve known Moreland would develop a strong
      strategic direction that would destroy their existing amenity. Your approvals
      are creating a canyon effect for the heritage overlay terraces.\r\n\r\nIs there
      an annual review of your incoherent strong strategic direction? It needs to
      properly consider equitable outcomes for existing and future residents, rather
      than favouring the fortune of developers, and driving inequality in Brunswick,
      and our society.\r\n\r\nHas there been any examples where you have pivoted,
      switched direction, learned lessons and stopped approving these inequitable
      plans?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nClaire"

      much of it commercial, along Gaffney Street and around the intersection between
      Sydney Road and Gaffney/Murray Roads.  The speed limit along Gaffney Street
      should be dropped to 50 kms/hr, although I am aware it is hard to enforce such
      limits.  However, pedestrians and cyclists need greater protection - I know
      from personal experience.  It was only recently while driving that I had to
      reroute down a side road as a cyclist had been hit by a car on what was a relatively
      quiet day.  \r\n\r\nWhile I have nothing against the proposed hotel, I wonder
      why on earth you would have a child centre located within the development.  Given
      that there is an existing  child care centre within the Pentridge development
      and a new one proposed for Elizabeth Street, North Coburg, how many child care
      centres do we need?  Such a centre would further increase traffic right next
      to a major intersection that has had its fair share of accidents.  "

    text: Everyone in this street. PROTEST.  3 on 1 block is too many.!!!!! Walk around
      to the end of Struan Ave and see the mess your street will be turned into.  For
      years!!  Plastic and rubbish everywhere.  Dust covering everything.  Loud machinery
      from 6 a.m. Be warned and PROTEST.  I realise some development has to take place
      but with limits and more council inspections re the site conditions.

      listed above.\r\nOver May year and with meeting with council members regarding
      the congestion the parking issues on this particular street ( Wilsons Lane ).
      The addition of another large development on such a small envelope of land on
      a corner block will only create even more parking issues which has been already
      created from the approval and lack of parking on the unit development which
      your council has already approved ( the units next door to this site on Wilsons
      Lane). The parking on Wilsons lane will only get worse on the crest of the hill,
      with oncoming cars having to cross to the other side of the road due to the
      car parking of the unit owners/ tenants which is already dangerous as it is.\r\nI
      will be coming to council this afternoon to discuss these issues \r\n\r\nThanks

    text: "The  old SA state legislation, for well over the last 10 years , actually
      prohibited the relevant planning authorities (usually councils) from taking
      most, if not all, of these issues you mention into consideration when trying
      to alter or withhold approval from these development. If the council did disallow
      or seek to alter the applications, and were then taken to the ERDC court on
      any of those issues mentioned - the councils often incured legal fees of  $15K
      - $80K a time , just to get immediately overrulled and then have developers,
      state politicians and individuals decry the waste of ratepayer's money and the
      difficulty of getting development approval. \r\nThat \"red tape\" that state
      politicians said held development back, was very often the legislated attempts
      to take into account the views of the actual community that surrounded the development,
      that \"red tape\" is now also essentially removed by the new state legislation.
      \r\nI can build a 2 storey townhouse within 2m of my neighbours boundary, and
      council is actually in breach of the law if it attempts to directly notify my
      neighbour even just of its reciept of that approval of that Cat 1 development,
      much less divulge the details or the unavoidable approval of that development.
      \r\nThe new state legislation of now removes the ownership of the approval process
      from local authorities to the state government. --- Its not going to get any
      better,---  blaming the council just lets the state government off the hook.
      \r\nIf people think the council  brings in appreciably more rates due to residential
      lowrise/medium density development, you are just running the developers propaganda
      for them, its not actually the case - if you go through the council budgets
      its quite obvious, it will need to increase rates because the council does need
      to upgrade stormwater but under state legislation IT CANNOT charge the 100's
      of single site developers whose incremental development makes the upgrade neccessary.
      \r\nSmall disclaimer: I do not, and never have worked for the marion council,
      and this is not to be taken as professional planing advice."

      main reason for the upturn in the economy is the increased amount of tourism

      be treated with so much more respect and VISION than the proposed plans show.
      \r\nIf the windows were not already boarded up I would gaffa tape myself to
      them to stop the demolition of the shop front in favour of a generic glass box
      with electronic doors...there are plenty of those already in Launceston and
      they’re so bland I rarely notice them or bother to enter the shops (filled with
      generic mass produced ‘product’)\r\n\r\nLaunceston is running out of old gems
      like this which are visually interesting, elegantly constructed and embody links
      with an historical past as well as an architectural and cultural and artistic
      Australian Heritage. Visitors come to Launceston specifically because of the
      beautiful old buildings and quieter way of life. The council planners continue
      to ignore what a community finds interesting and holds dear, in the vain attempt
      at “Making Launceston Great Again” by approving developments that attempt to
      emulate their idea of what a Big Important City should look like. Yawn!\r\n\r\nIf
      this shop front demolition goes ahead then Launceston really will justify its
      status as a destination not worth visiting (as featured in comedian Tom Gleeson’s
      spoof travel show segment “Go Away” https://youtu.be/32eKGFeoQeo )\r\n\r\nHatton
      & Laws was the oldest continually operated pharmacy in Australia, on this site
      since 1848. I’m gobsmacked that it’s not a heritage listed shop front!!! \r\nThis
      facade is a stunning extant example of 1920’s/30’s architectural shop front
      design and I’m atruggling to think of another example in Tasmania, let alone
      the rest of the country!\r\nTo have this replaced with a generic, bland and
      soulless replication of what already exists in most cities is an insult to Launceston.
      \r\n\r\nAs much as I do actually love some contemporary architecture which really
      responds to the Australian climate and the context of the site within which
      it sits, this old girl holds a special place in many people’s hearts & Complacency
      is not the answer!!!\r\nWe must look after our cultural heritage because it’s
      what unites us as a community and gives us our unique advantage over other locations.
      \r\nAnd for a jewellery shop I would have thought the existing curved windows
      and stained glass and tiled design would have been a visual drawcard. \r\nAnother
      example of lack of cultural respect and selfishness by a franchised retailer
      over what the local community holds dear. \r\nIt breaks my heart. "

    text: "I wholeheartedly believe that the demolition of the cottages in Denbeigh
      Street should not have occurred. I actually recently walked through the highset
      cottage which was demolished and I cannot understand how this demolition can
      have been allowed. If every old Queenslander in Parramatta Park and Cairns North
      is subject to the testing that the engineers who compiled the report theoretically
      relied on, we will have no heritage or historical buildings left. \r\n\r\nThe
      complete lack of community consultation in these matters is disgraceful. I have
      video footage of the demolition of one of the houses and it is guttung.  Denbeigh
      Street is a character precinct street and demolition of these houses is disturbing.
      We cannot get our heritage back once destroyed and Cairns’ heritage belongs
      to all of the community, not just a few developers."

      the chance these iconic workers cottages would have been done up an they should
      be given first option .. how are developers allowed to demolish these beautiful

      demolition may i add.. Where is the protection of these homes gone.\r\nThis
      is the 6 th home in 2 blocks to disappear from history in the last 18 months.

      will be nightmare and make a dangerous and busy corner worse...can't believe
      it would be even considered...but it seems anything goes as shown by the permit
      granted for the massive tower to be built on cnr of Whitehorse and Elgar rds...Vcat

      will completely block off the morning sun from most of our dining and living
      room area.The fact that we have this beautiful sunlight streaming into the room
      was a deciding factor in us purchasing this home. We don't have any objections

    text: North Toowoomba, one of Toowoombas oldest suburbs, needs to be protected.  I
      am also trying for common sense to prevail in my street, Walton Street. Our
      little dead end street has had dwelling numbers DOUBLE with another application
      on the table at council for more.  Every car that comes into my little street
      has to go out the same way. It seems to be a drag strip down the hill to Ruthven
      with the noise level of vehicles horrendous. The "footpath" out the front of
      my home is less than a metre. Visitors needing to find a parking spot from the
      units, block our driveways by parking opposite gateways.  I want the council
      to refer these applications to the State and maybe then we can get some unjust
      Development Applications stopped at the highest level.  Someone has to care!!
      Quality of life is important to all, and our heritage needs to remain for our
      future generations!

      old and possibly older - they can live for up to 450 years old. They are also
      of huge  significance to the Indigenous community.  These plants do not transplant
      as they have a very complex root system.  Any development could not take place
      within at least five meters of the plant, so as not to disrupt its fragile root
      system.  So amazing to see such a spectacular grass tree has survived the city''s
      development.    '

    text: I agree with all of the comments that have been posted so far. We had a
      similar situation in Bridge/Cavell Streets. A proposal to built multiple two-storied
      units on conjoining blocks, necessitating the removal of two older houses. By
      any stretch of the imagination, consider that the units in Mansford Street will
      require car parking for at least five (5) vehicles, let alone visitors. Also
      we will be looking at Twenty-four (24) wheelie bins, Plus the associated noise,
      odour , etc from them. Also, the ever increasing amount of couriers delivering
      parcels, packages, etc due to the change in purchasing habits of the city. I
      see at least three, to four of these deliveries each day in my street, which
      is fairly wide and access is not difficult. Once again  we are being screwed
      by the people we elected to govern our city on our behalf.

      but that entrance to Harding off Morphett Road is very dangerous and congested
      particularly if cars are parked either side. It is difficult to navigate and
      so any development there will need to have adequate off street  parking and
      limited on street so as to free up the area for cars to pass through.

        trying to manage this type of impact to the best of their ability.\n\nWhilst
        I do not want our Council to ever be seen as heavy handed or over regulatory,
        sometimes the \"stick\" is needed. \nAnd so there are local and State laws
        around illegal parking.\n I recommend you call it in for action if you believe
        such behaviour in your patch is beyond what a reasonable person expects from
        good neighbours. \nWe are in this together after all and some people do push
        the boundaries at times.\n\nI also have a view that people who have a lot
        of \"toys\" they use, and good luck to them for it, need to take responsibility
        for their storage. Thankfully we are spoilt for choice in Redlands and can
        \ choose to rent or purchase the right property with plenty of space for our
        goods. Just not in a smaller lot if that is our choice.  Another good option
        is finding a private storage facility or with friends or family perhaps. \nIt
        is not very reasonable to expect that public land is available for recreational
        items, or multiple vehicles, to be stored if I have chosen a small lot for
        location or other personal reasons. \n\nI agree that parking rates and storage
        needs to match the zoning and intended usage. These should be reviewed from
        time to time in city plans and State guidelines to make sure they are meeting
        current trends. This Council is very conscious of trying to get the right
        \"rates\" in the right areas. There are a broad range of opinions on what
        is \"right\" as our area becomes more popular. There are also State guided
        restrictions to what we are able to do independently. \nWe need ongoing and
        broad public feedback to do the best with current information.\n\nPeter"

    text: "I would like to profusely object to the planned development of the site
      93-97 Webb street Fitzroy, as proposed by the private developer in their application
      to the City of Yarra (reference PLN17/1061).\r\n\r\nThis will be a monstrosity
      of a building in what VCAT (unlike our elected members of Council who do the
      right thing and object to plans that the community overwhelmingly oppose) is
      likely to hear an appeal of.\r\n\r\n7 storeys is a ludicrous height of a development
      in what is 90% single storey heritage listed residential homes.\r\n\r\nI am
      personally traumatised by the impact this will have directly on my business.
      \ I am the founded and operator of The 86 Cabaret Bar at 185 Smith street Fitzroy,
      which is a safe space for the diverse LGBTI community as well as for cabaret
      performers, for musicians, dancers and comedians, and is the only small cocktail
      bar in this area of Smith street that caters to the late night clientele (1am-3am)\r\n\r\nAfter
      going through 7 years of objections to the development which VCAT gave the go
      ahead of, known as the Coles Development site directly in front of THE 86, where
      the internal of our venue was constantly covered in dust and such damaged machinery
      and defected fixtures and fittings from the months of digging.  Then there was
      the evening street ambience that has been destroyed entirely by Coles demand
      for 24 hour bright white fluorescent lighting which erodes the ambience we set
      to.  Then there were the dreaded noise complaints once tenants started to move
      in.  Double Glazed they said! They wont hear a thing they said!  \r\n\r\nThis
      development would be a greater impact on our venue due to its proximity being
      less than 4 metres and effects how our business would operate and if it lead
      to a change or closure of our operations would be detrimental to thousands of
      local people who gather at The 86 for a variety of fringe entertainment and
      offerings every month.\r\n\r\nThere is no way any developer can curtail the
      objections of their buyers to what will be the sounds of live performance and
      music which in the past decade has started to rebuild Yarra's damaged arts and
      entertainment precinct of the once thriving Smith street.  This development
      would go about limiting access for our delivery trucks to access the rear of
      our building, our rehearsal band and dance studio spaces which are used throughout
      the day via this rear access and most of all our live shows and music and whole
      entertainment work of The 86 would be reduced to only presenting works that
      can be done quietly with sound levels simile heard in seniors nursing care facilities.\r\n\r\nThis
      development as proposed by the applicant must be rejected and encouragement
      for such to go back and consult the community, the existing occupants and work
      with us so we can continue to inhabit the area as we have always done, the fibre
      and fabric of the area is not grossly affected and existing households are not
      deprived the sunshine they have lived under.  Some for more than the past 50
      years.\r\n\r\nI note: At no point has anyone from the developers office issued
      a letter of introduction, advised of their planning intent directly or made
      a personal effort to understand what we do and how we go about doing such.  A
      reminder of how little concern the multi million dollar monstrosity makers have
      for us ground feeders.  \r\n\r\nVCAT you must see that this adds nothing to
      the community, will take away much of the social energy of this area of Smith
      street and in turn only end up lining the pockets of a handful of greedy developers.\r\n\r\n"

    text: "Dear Shire of Yarra Ranges Planning Department. I am concerned that the
      proposed development at 1533 Burwood Highway is an over-development of the site
      due to:\r\n1. being the only building in the strip with 2 storeys and which
      will \r\n2. block out the beautiful view of the mountains behind it.\r\n\r\nIt
      is inappropriate to set a precedent of 2-3 storey dwellings in this small mountain
      village, whose very appeal to both locals and tourists relies on its lack of
      over-development, unlike most of Melbourne, and visual access to the natural
      environment.\r\n\r\nI note that there is also no space for any plant life whatsoever,
      as it completely fills the site. The drawing provided shows potted plants on
      the balconies to give an effect of some green but in reality there is no guarantee
      that this imposing building will any way reflect its environment.\r\n\r\nFurther,
      the lack of required car spaces being provided is also inappropriate. Anybody
      who uses the existing car parks there will know that there are times when no
      car parking spots are available, such as at school pick up and drop off, twice
      a day, 5 days a week. "

    text: "We are neighbouring property to this address.  The proposed 3 storey development
      at over 8m high at this address is extremely concerning and inappropriate for
      the following reasons.\r\n\r\n1) There is no set back from the boundary.  There
      is no property in the area that has habitable buildings on the boundary as this
      house is.\r\n\r\n2) The height of the building is inappropriate for the area.
      \ The building will tower over numerous neighbouring properties.  1 meter higher
      than the roof of the existing dwelling is too tall.  The existing established
      trees on the south east fence line of 213 Churchill will not offer protection
      into our back yard or our open plan living, dining and kitchen with floor to
      ceiling glass 12meters long, plus our upstairs bedroom and ensuite.  With the
      dwelling being built so close to the south east and north east fence lines,
      it is unlikely that the trees will survive the building process with proposed
      excavation.\r\n\r\n3) There is inadequate parking in the area for an 11 bedroom
      dwelling.  The plans show 6 bedrooms but it is clear that with 11 rooms (excluding
      living areas) and 2 kitchens, the intended purpose for this property is student
      accommodation that could potentially house up to 40 people with multiple people
      living in each room.  \r\n\r\nThis building is poorly designed, will not fit
      within the area and needs redesigning at an appropriate height and size to fit
      within the neighbourhood for sake of privacy and quality of living. \r\n"

      2018 / 36729 / V2L\r\nProperty Location: 285 Oakey Flat Road, MORAYFIELD QLD
      4506 \r\n      293 Oakey Flat Road, MORAYFIELD QLD 4506 \r\n      87 Burbury
      Road, MORAYFIELD QLD 4506 MORAYFIELD QLD 4506\r\nProperty Description: Lot Lot
      8 RP 196576, Lot 2 RP 804516, Lot 3 RP 804516\r\n\r\nWe wish to make you aware
      of a number of strong objections that numerous residents of Morayfield South
      have with regard to the proposed Material Change of Use - for Local Centre Precinct
      (including day-care retail fast food, Service Station ancillary retail) \r\nThis
      application contradicts the Caboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional Activity
      Centre in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031in the following
      respects:\r\nWe strongly object to the building of a shopping centre, petrol
      service station, fast food, retail and the high density housing etc in what
      is a residential and rural residential area. \r\nWe object to the destruction
      of the healthy urban ecosystem these lots and this area has, this part of Morayfield
      South is typical of an older rural residential area, as well as having large
      densities of mature large trees and occasional watercourse it is also home to
      a wide variety of native bird and wildlife. \r\nKoalas, many Kangaroos are often
      seen in this area.\r\nThe endangered black cockatoo and many other birds often
      feed and live in the vegetation found in the area the developers want to clear
      cut.\r\nMorayfield Souths healthy urban ecosystem is already under duress with
      the slash and burn, clear cutting of neighbouring lots but the whole suburb
      is not yet totally destroyed. \r\nIt is not too late for MBRC to protect what
      remains by refusing applications of this sort.\r\nThe very reason why we and
      many others brought into a master planned acreage properties suburb was not
      to have what the developers and MBRC are trying to force onto us now. \r\nWe
      brought into Morayfield south for the acreage residential healthy ecosystem
      lifestyle, not high density, shopping centres, fast food and petrol stations.\r\nDestruction
      of Acreage Lifestyle and Urban Ecosystem\r\nI and many others believe MBRC should
      encourage developments to create places and spaces which meet the needs and
      provide land choices of all people (not just the destructive high density living
      developments that this application propose) are visually attractive, safe, accessible,
      functional and fully funded by the developer, be inclusive for people and wildlife,
      have their own distinctive identity which maintains our acreage properties local
      character. \r\nThe acreage properties of Morayfield South living in harmony
      with our native wild life present MBRC an incredible opportunity to protect
      and commercially promote this unique type of lifestyle and accommodation choices.\r\nHow
      many suburbs do you know of close to amenities in MBRC area that still have
      Koala's, kangaroos, Echidna, Bandicoots along with masses of native birds on
      their properties daily? \r\nAll which are protected species by law!\r\nBut what’s
      the point of protecting the species if council doesn't protect the habitat they
      need to survive.\r\nIf the proposed development went ahead as planned our lifestyle
      and the area’s wildlife habitat would be lost forever to the detriment of us
      and our future generations! \r\nWe believe this application proposal to contravene
      MBRC own guidance as it is to the detriment of the quality, character and amenity
      value of our suburb. \r\nCouncil have an obligation to plan our suburbs considering
      all aspects of that suburb including its wildlife and the residents that actually
      live there. \r\nNot just the developer who lives nowhere near the slum they
      propose.\r\nThe close dealing MBRC councillors and employees have with the companies
      concerned with the destruction of Morayfield South does nothing to restore the
      public’s confidence that all applications concerning Morayfield South are without
      corruption, unethical behaviour or conflicts of interest.\r\nThe Moreton Futures
      Trust that many of the MBRC councillors involved in Morayfield South have an
      active interest in is another source of mistrust for this area’s rate payers.
      \r\nMany Morayfield South rate payers are adamant that the companies involved
      in development applications concerning Morayfield South have prejudiced the
      interests of council to accept and force through their applications to the detriment
      of the rate payers that own acreage property.  \r\nWe believe the residents
      that live in Morayfield south are not against proper reasonable development
      of the area, a development that highlights the value of acreage living alongside
      a healthy native urban ecosystem. \r\nBut we are against the over-development,
      high density type developments that this application want and MBRC are considering
      for our suburb. This type of infill development is much better suited to areas
      closer to Morayfield and Caboolture centre where public transport and other
      crucial infrastructure already exists. \r\nCouncil has the opportunity to develop
      Morayfield South into a purpose built affordable acreage suburb not just another
      Brisbane outer suburb high density dormitory rental slum suburb with all the
      issues and social problems that come with them. \r\nCurrent demand and prices
      show that acreage properties are very much sort after by rate payers that don’t
      want to live in in a high density suburb. Those rate payers should not be forced
      to move due to the suburb, the lifestyle, the native urban ecosystem around
      them being clear cut and destroyed.\r\nMBRC needs to learn from the mistakes
      councils like Logan and Ipswich have made approving so many high density rental
      developments in their area and the dangerous social issues those suburbs now
      have to live with daily.\r\nMorayfield South has some of the best acreage properties
      left in Southeast Qld, why does council not consider for Morayfield South  a
      quality purpose built acreage suburb with homes on 5,4,3,2,1, half or three
      quarter acre blocks. Look at the “hideaway estate” off Hunt road as a great
      example, or the small acreage estate just finished on Hauton Road that blends
      in perfectly with the suburb.\r\nIt is now time to ensure our native woodlands,
      the native wildlife that relies on them for their habitats, are afforded much
      better protection. It’s time for MBRC  to show the community it is putting in
      place reforms leading to land clearing rates falling significantly. However,
      it is crucial that remaining habitat including regrowth is retained within the
      urban and peri urban footprint. Koala surveys undertaken over many years confirm
      the importance of retaining this type of ‘mature’ vegetation for the remaining
      residential koala populations. These sites also become vital ‘sinks’ for displaced
      koalas and other wildlife coming from areas previously totally cleared of vegetation
      for these high density applications and their related infrastructure.\r\nWater
      Run Off \r\nThe Morton Bay shire already has some of the worst water quality
      in its creeks, rivers and catchment areas in Queensland ultimately affecting
      the water quality of Moreton Bay. Some experts believe this poor water quality
      is due to the high density over development of our area. The destruction of
      100% of the vegetation on this site and replacing it with a surface that is
      impervious to water penetration will only add to the run off and carrying with
      it all the pollutants that a commercial/retail and high density residential
      site will produce. The delicate wetlands ecosystems of the area that are not
      far from the rear of this property would be directly affected by run off pollution
      from this site, flowing onto other areas of Morayfield and Burpengary and eventually
      contributing to the pollution of Morton bay .\r\nThe MBRC web site even states
      the following:” Water is a scarce and essential naturel resource. Conserving
      and maintaining water quality is especially important in Australia. Preventing
      or reducing water pollution protects our water quality and is essential to maintaining
      the health of our environment and our own quality of life.”\r\nThe close proximity
      of a vital water way to a service station and the petrochemical pollutants that
      will be washed off the stations drive way and parking area into our water ways
      has not been adequately addressed. \r\nTraffic congestion\r\nThe proposed development
      is on a busy road the risks of an accident are very real.\r\nThe road infrastructure
      for the area is already at saturation point.\r\nBottlenecks already occur daily
      along Oakey Flat and Walkers Road. The surrounding roads are then used as rat
      runs as commuters try to find any possible access out of the area. This puts
      the residents of Morayfield south at unnecessary risk to this type of congestion.
      \r\nThe close by, purpose built Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield
      have the adequate road infrastructure already in place to cope with the volume
      of traffic service stations and retail shopping centres produce.\r\nInfill Developments
      of this type will only increase the road saturation as it will deviate traffic
      away from the purpose built road infrastructure closer to the Regional Activity
      Centre which was purpose planned and built for these types of developments.\r\nThe
      risk to other people using Oakey Flat road along with all other roads around
      the proposed development will increase, with the increase of traffic in the
      area along with traffic turning in and exiting traffic. The additional noise
      and light pollution along visual and vehicle pollution as a result of the additional
      traffic will have a negative impact directly on us, our neighbours and the areas
      wildlife. \r\nThe proposed plans and the Morayfield South road infrastructure
      do not allow for the amount of traffic that a development of this type would
      generate, It is unreasonable for the rate payers of MBRC to have to bear the
      additional road infrastructure costs and local road repairs cost that a development
      of this type would require.\r\n It is also unreasonable for the residents of
      Morayfield South to have to waste more of their time gridlocked in traffic due
      to high density developments being built in areas where the road infrastructure
      is insufficient to bear the load. Approval of such developments as the proposed
      will make commuting through Morayfield south a traffic congestion nightmare.\r\nEvery
      route in Morayfield South will be over capacity if MBRC continue to approve
      these and other types of in fill applications.\r\nWe the residents of Morayfield
      south didn’t purchase our acreage properties here to have MBRC over approve
      high density housing estates in our suburb. We chose to purchase in a suburb
      that had space, lifestyle and a healthy urban ecosystem. If MBRC continue to
      approve developments of this nature Morayfield South will become one of the
      most congested suburbs in the whole region.\r\nMBRC has an obligation to the
      residents that purchased a acreage lifestyle that already call Morayfield South
      home and MBRCare employed to preserve our chosen lifestyle and native urban
      ecosystem.\r\nBy MBRC approving applications of this nature council is destroying
      our lifestyle, the current residents of Morayfield south already have to fight
      our way through traffic gridlock every morning and every afternoon wasting valuable
      time we should be spending with family, at work or at play.\r\nThere are already
      areas in Morayfield north and Caboolture that are much more suited for this
      type of high density development with adequate road infrastructure already built
      capable of moving the traffic that this type of development would produce. \r\nIt
      makes total sense to keep this type of commercial activity within the original
      Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield area for so many valid
      reasons eg; public safety, proper road infrastructure, public transport, pollution
      control, security, protecting our native wildlife’s environment and habitat
      along with protecting the place where we live, sleep and call home.\r\nThe need
      for this business to be built in this location has no logic as the the Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre is less than 2.5 km away a mere three minute car
      ride or less than 20 minute walk. \r\nCaboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional
      Activity Centre \r\nThe Morayfield Caboolture Activity Centre already has ample,
      GP surgeries, shops, vets, supermarkets and restaurants along with a vast amount
      of vacant commercial property for sale/ lease or unoccupied in the Morayfield
      Cabooltures service centre, the alleged demand for more retail and commercial
      properties is not warranted. Another petrol station is defiantly not warranted
      especially one built next to people’s homes.\r\nThe closing of the large Caboolture
      Sand and Gravel site at 369 Morayfield road and its development into more commercial
      activities has also added to the already ample supply of commercial activity
      in this area. \r\nIt is important to note that one of the new businesses to
      open at 369 Morayfield road is yet another petrol service station. This service
      station will be only 2.5km less than a 3 minute drive from the proposed development.
      Morayfield south currently has three petrol service stations with retail outlets
      all within a 2.5 to 2.9 km from 293-285 Oakey Flat Road.\r\nApproving the building
      of a shopping centre, fast food, petrol station in this bushland residential
      area is not only totally not needed, but out of place with the suburb and also
      a vast injustice to the current business owners who have taken the risk and
      invested in and started their business within the boundaries of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre under the belief that commercial activity
      and therefore the concentration of their clients would be confined within the
      Caboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional Activity Centre.\r\nThe Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre also has the existing transport and infrastructure
      to cater for these types of commercial activities already in place.\r\nThere
      are currently 18 service stations serving the Caboolture/Morayfield area the
      furthest away from the proposed sited are the two service stations on Beerburrum
      Road at only 5.3km an approximate 9 minute drive. The three closest service
      stations are only a mere 2.5 km and 2.9 km away approximately 3 minutes’ drive.
      The other Eightteen service stations are spread between Caboolture, the Bruce
      Hwy and Morayfield commercial district less than 5km away with yet another opened
      on Uhlmann road.\r\nThere is also the three service stations at Burpengary tower
      shopping centre as well only 6km away or 7 minute drive.\r\nThe developer’s
      claims that the area needs more commercial properties are unjustified, with
      the Woolworths Aldi Supa Centre only 2.6 km less than 3minutes. With BCF, Bunnings,
      Goodguys and many more commercial activities also the same distance away. \r\nMinor
      Convenience shopping is adequately supplied with convenience shopping available
      at the corner of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road, Seven 11 and BP and other shops
      less than 3 minutes away.\r\nThe owners of the independent shops at the corner
      of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road have invested in serving the community for
      over 20 years, the destruction of their livelihood and reduction in consumer
      choice by allowing the large commercial retail such as Coles and Woolworths
      to force the smaller independent retailer out of business and then price gouging
      us by increasing prices due to no competition is a crime.\r\n Small local retail
      Competition is essential to us the residents of Morayfield south for our economic
      prosperity. Small independent business, competing against retail giants such
      as Coles and Woolworths have no chance of survival.\r\nYet Retail space devoted
      to food sales in the Caboolture Morayfield Burpengary has hit a record high
      with multiple shopping centres opened recently in the areas Principal Regional
      Activity Centre along Morayfield and Station road.\r\nDepartment stores such
      as Myers & David Jones followed the same strategy in the last decade, and now
      they are closing stores and filing for bankruptcy at staggering rates.\r\nThe
      Caboolture Morayfield area has one on Australia’s largest population of obese
      adults and children, it would be morally wrong for MBRC to approve any junk
      fast food outlet in any rural and residential area.\r\nThe last thing this area
      needs is any form is a service station or junk fast food outlets; the roads
      and waterways in our area are already used as dumping points for wrappings and
      rubbish from the nearby fast food outlets on Morayfield Rd thrown from cars
      and pedestrians littering our footpaths and properties.\r\n\r\nThe anti-social
      and criminal behaviour that these types of commercial centres attract is also
      something that this residential area does not want, commercial centres of this
      nature need to be kept within the boundaries of the Morayfield Caboolture Activity
      Centre where proper policing of these areas is achieved more efficiently and
      cost effectively by police services.\r\nThe purpose of planning and listing
      certain areas to set aside for retail and commercial properties in the Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre plan was to stop the ugly retail sprawl into residential
      areas and to centralise multiple retail activities making access to those services
      and for the clients to those retail areas easier and safer. And most importantly
      making the servicing of these businesses efficient and safer, no one wants to
      live next door to a petrol service station along with the associated risks and
      pollution a petrol service station will bring to a place where people live sleep
      and make their home. \r\nMBRC need to consider the considerable risk and disturbance
      of having large petrol tankers and supermarket semi-trailers using residential
      roads to deliver their products. \r\nThe proposed site is already within easy
      walking distance to the existing shopping complex Morayfield Supa Centre. Therefor
      the need for another retail/commercial centre is totally unnecessary for Morayfield
      south. Our area is already served by a multitude of commercial and retail choices
      along Moarayfeild road as well as a local owned independent IGA close by at
      the intersection of Oakey Flat Road and Nairn road. \r\nThe purpose of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre plan was to keep commercial activity and
      potentially dangerous commercial business centralised. \r\nTo allow this development
      to go ahead is a clear contradiction of that plans purpose. \r\nMany areas within
      the Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield north are much more
      suited for developments of this nature.\r\nPlease consider the valid reasons
      raised and reject the application Development Application \r\n 36729\r\n\r\nKind
      regards\r\nC Jones\r\nLot 91 SP 200423 Morayfield\r\n"

      concerned with the destruction of Morayfield South does nothing to restore the
      public’s confidence that all applications concerning Morayfield South are without
      corruption, unethical behaviour or conflicts of interest.\r\nThe Moreton Futures
      Trust that many of the MBRC councillors involved in Morayfield South have an
      active interest in is another source of mistrust for this area’s rate payers.
      \r\nMany Morayfield South rate payers are adamant that the companies involved
      in development applications concerning Morayfield South have prejudiced the
      interests of council to accept and force through their applications to the detriment
      of the rate payers that own acreage property.  \r\nWe believe the residents
      that live in Morayfield south are not against proper reasonable development
      of the area, a development that highlights the value of acreage living alongside
      a healthy native urban ecosystem. \r\nBut we are against the over-development,
      high density type developments that this application want and MBRC are considering
      for our suburb. This type of infill development is much better suited to areas
      closer to Morayfield and Caboolture centre where public transport and other
      crucial infrastructure already exists. \r\nCouncil has the opportunity to develop
      Morayfield South into a purpose built affordable acreage suburb not just another
      Brisbane outer suburb high density dormitory rental slum suburb with all the
      issues and social problems that come with them. \r\nCurrent demand and prices
      show that acreage properties are very much sort after by rate payers that don’t
      want to live in in a high density suburb. Those rate payers should not be forced
      to move due to the suburb, the lifestyle, the native urban ecosystem around
      them being clear cut and destroyed.\r\nMBRC needs to learn from the mistakes
      councils like Logan and Ipswich have made approving so many high density rental
      developments in their area and the dangerous social issues those suburbs now
      have to live with daily.\r\nMorayfield South has some of the best acreage properties
      left in Southeast Qld, why does council not consider for Morayfield South  a
      quality purpose built acreage suburb with homes on 5,4,3,2,1, half or three
      quarter acre blocks. Look at the “hideaway estate” off Hunt road as a great
      example, or the small acreage estate just finished on Hauton Road that blends
      in perfectly with the suburb.\r\nIt is now time to ensure our native woodlands,
      the native wildlife that relies on them for their habitats, are afforded much
      better protection. It’s time for MBRC  to show the community it is putting in
      place reforms leading to land clearing rates falling significantly. However,
      it is crucial that remaining habitat including regrowth is retained within the
      urban and peri urban footprint. Koala surveys undertaken over many years confirm
      the importance of retaining this type of ‘mature’ vegetation for the remaining
      residential koala populations. These sites also become vital ‘sinks’ for displaced
      koalas and other wildlife coming from areas previously totally cleared of vegetation
      for these high density applications and their related infrastructure.\r\nWater
      Run Off \r\nThe Morton Bay shire already has some of the worst water quality
      in its creeks, rivers and catchment areas in Queensland ultimately affecting
      the water quality of Moreton Bay. Some experts believe this poor water quality
      is due to the high density over development of our area. The destruction of
      100% of the vegetation on this site and replacing it with a surface that is
      impervious to water penetration will only add to the run off and carrying with
      it all the pollutants that a commercial/retail and high density residential
      site will produce. The delicate wetlands ecosystems of the area that are not
      far from the rear of this property would be directly affected by run off pollution
      from this site, flowing onto other areas of Morayfield and Burpengary and eventually
      contributing to the pollution of Morton bay .\r\nThe MBRC web site even states
      the following:” Water is a scarce and essential naturel resource. Conserving
      and maintaining water quality is especially important in Australia. Preventing
      or reducing water pollution protects our water quality and is essential to maintaining
      the health of our environment and our own quality of life.”\r\nThe close proximity
      of a vital water way to a service station and the petrochemical pollutants that
      will be washed off the stations drive way and parking area into our water ways
      has not been adequately addressed. \r\nTraffic congestion\r\nThe proposed development
      is on a busy road the risks of an accident are very real.\r\nThe road infrastructure
      for the area is already at saturation point.\r\nBottlenecks already occur daily
      along Oakey Flat and Walkers Road. The surrounding roads are then used as rat
      runs as commuters try to find any possible access out of the area. This puts
      the residents of Morayfield south at unnecessary risk to this type of congestion.
      \r\nThe close by, purpose built Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield
      have the adequate road infrastructure already in place to cope with the volume
      of traffic service stations and retail shopping centres produce.\r\nInfill Developments
      of this type will only increase the road saturation as it will deviate traffic
      away from the purpose built road infrastructure closer to the Regional Activity
      Centre which was purpose planned and built for these types of developments.\r\nThe
      risk to other people using Oakey Flat road along with all other roads around
      the proposed development will increase, with the increase of traffic in the
      area along with traffic turning in and exiting traffic. The additional noise
      and light pollution along visual and vehicle pollution as a result of the additional
      traffic will have a negative impact directly on us, our neighbours and the areas
      wildlife. \r\nThe proposed plans and the Morayfield South road infrastructure
      do not allow for the amount of traffic that a development of this type would
      generate, It is unreasonable for the rate payers of MBRC to have to bear the
      additional road infrastructure costs and local road repairs cost that a development
      of this type would require.\r\n It is also unreasonable for the residents of
      Morayfield South to have to waste more of their time gridlocked in traffic due
      to high density developments being built in areas where the road infrastructure
      is insufficient to bear the load. Approval of such developments as the proposed
      will make commuting through Morayfield south a traffic congestion nightmare.\r\nEvery
      route in Morayfield South will be over capacity if MBRC continue to approve
      these and other types of in fill applications.\r\nWe the residents of Morayfield
      south didn’t purchase our acreage properties here to have MBRC over approve
      high density housing estates in our suburb. We chose to purchase in a suburb
      that had space, lifestyle and a healthy urban ecosystem. If MBRC continue to
      approve developments of this nature Morayfield South will become one of the
      most congested suburbs in the whole region.\r\nMBRC has an obligation to the
      residents that purchased a acreage lifestyle that already call Morayfield South
      home and MBRCare employed to preserve our chosen lifestyle and native urban
      ecosystem.\r\nBy MBRC approving applications of this nature council is destroying
      our lifestyle, the current residents of Morayfield south already have to fight
      our way through traffic gridlock every morning and every afternoon wasting valuable
      time we should be spending with family, at work or at play.\r\nThere are already
      areas in Morayfield north and Caboolture that are much more suited for this
      type of high density development with adequate road infrastructure already built
      capable of moving the traffic that this type of development would produce. \r\nIt
      makes total sense to keep this type of commercial activity within the original
      Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield area for so many valid
      reasons eg; public safety, proper road infrastructure, public transport, pollution
      control, security, protecting our native wildlife’s environment and habitat
      along with protecting the place where we live, sleep and call home.\r\nThe need
      for this business to be built in this location has no logic as the the Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre is less than 2.5 km away a mere three minute car
      ride or less than 20 minute walk. \r\nCaboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional
      Activity Centre \r\nThe Morayfield Caboolture Activity Centre already has ample,
      GP surgeries, shops, vets, supermarkets and restaurants along with a vast amount
      of vacant commercial property for sale/ lease or unoccupied in the Morayfield
      Cabooltures service centre, the alleged demand for more retail and commercial
      properties is not warranted. Another petrol station is defiantly not warranted
      especially one built next to people’s homes.\r\nThe closing of the large Caboolture
      Sand and Gravel site at 369 Morayfield road and its development into more commercial
      activities has also added to the already ample supply of commercial activity
      in this area. \r\nIt is important to note that one of the new businesses to
      open at 369 Morayfield road is yet another petrol service station. This service
      station will be only 2.5km less than a 3 minute drive from the proposed development.
      Morayfield south currently has three petrol service stations with retail outlets
      all within a 2.5 to 2.9 km from 293-285 Oakey Flat Road.\r\nApproving the building
      of a shopping centre, fast food, petrol station in this bushland residential
      area is not only totally not needed, but out of place with the suburb and also
      a vast injustice to the current business owners who have taken the risk and
      invested in and started their business within the boundaries of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre under the belief that commercial activity
      and therefore the concentration of their clients would be confined within the
      Caboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional Activity Centre.\r\nThe Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre also has the existing transport and infrastructure
      to cater for these types of commercial activities already in place.\r\nThere
      are currently 18 service stations serving the Caboolture/Morayfield area the
      furthest away from the proposed sited are the two service stations on Beerburrum
      Road at only 5.3km an approximate 9 minute drive. The three closest service
      stations are only a mere 2.5 km and 2.9 km away approximately 3 minutes’ drive.
      The other Eightteen service stations are spread between Caboolture, the Bruce
      Hwy and Morayfield commercial district less than 5km away with yet another opened
      on Uhlmann road.\r\nThere is also the three service stations at Burpengary tower
      shopping centre as well only 6km away or 7 minute drive.\r\nThe developer’s
      claims that the area needs more commercial properties are unjustified, with
      the Woolworths Aldi Supa Centre only 2.6 km less than 3minutes. With BCF, Bunnings,
      Goodguys and many more commercial activities also the same distance away. \r\nMinor
      Convenience shopping is adequately supplied with convenience shopping available
      at the corner of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road, Seven 11 and BP and other shops
      less than 3 minutes away.\r\nThe owners of the independent shops at the corner
      of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road have invested in serving the community for
      over 20 years, the destruction of their livelihood and reduction in consumer
      choice by allowing the large commercial retail such as Coles and Woolworths
      to force the smaller independent retailer out of business and then price gouging
      us by increasing prices due to no competition is a crime.\r\n Small local retail
      Competition is essential to us the residents of Morayfield south for our economic
      prosperity. Small independent business, competing against retail giants such
      as Coles and Woolworths have no chance of survival.\r\nYet Retail space devoted
      to food sales in the Caboolture Morayfield Burpengary has hit a record high
      with multiple shopping centres opened recently in the areas Principal Regional
      Activity Centre along Morayfield and Station road.\r\nDepartment stores such
      as Myers & David Jones followed the same strategy in the last decade, and now
      they are closing stores and filing for bankruptcy at staggering rates.\r\nThe
      Caboolture Morayfield area has one on Australia’s largest population of obese
      adults and children, it would be morally wrong for MBRC to approve any junk
      fast food outlet in any rural and residential area.\r\nThe last thing this area
      needs is any form is a service station or junk fast food outlets; the roads
      and waterways in our area are already used as dumping points for wrappings and
      rubbish from the nearby fast food outlets on Morayfield Rd thrown from cars
      and pedestrians littering our footpaths and properties.\r\n\r\nThe anti-social
      and criminal behaviour that these types of commercial centres attract is also
      something that this residential area does not want, commercial centres of this
      nature need to be kept within the boundaries of the Morayfield Caboolture Activity
      Centre where proper policing of these areas is achieved more efficiently and
      cost effectively by police services.\r\nThe purpose of planning and listing
      certain areas to set aside for retail and commercial properties in the Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre plan was to stop the ugly retail sprawl into residential
      areas and to centralise multiple retail activities making access to those services
      and for the clients to those retail areas easier and safer. And most importantly
      making the servicing of these businesses efficient and safer, no one wants to
      live next door to a petrol service station along with the associated risks and
      pollution a petrol service station will bring to a place where people live sleep
      and make their home. \r\nMBRC need to consider the considerable risk and disturbance
      of having large petrol tankers and supermarket semi-trailers using residential
      roads to deliver their products. \r\nThe proposed site is already within easy
      walking distance to the existing shopping complex Morayfield Supa Centre. Therefor
      the need for another retail/commercial centre is totally unnecessary for Morayfield
      south. Our area is already served by a multitude of commercial and retail choices
      along Moarayfeild road as well as a local owned independent IGA close by at
      the intersection of Oakey Flat Road and Nairn road. \r\nThe purpose of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre plan was to keep commercial activity and
      potentially dangerous commercial business centralised. \r\nTo allow this development
      to go ahead is a clear contradiction of that plans purpose. \r\nMany areas within
      the Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield north are much more
      suited for developments of this nature.\r\nPlease consider the valid reasons
      raised and reject the application Development Application \r\n 36729\r\n\r\nKind
      regards\r\nC Jones\r\nLot 91 SP 200423 Morayfield\r\n"

      2018 / 36729 / V2L\r\nProperty Location: 285 Oakey Flat Road, MORAYFIELD QLD

      Road, MORAYFIELD QLD 4506 MORAYFIELD QLD 4506\r\nProperty Description: Lot Lot
      8 RP 196576, Lot 2 RP 804516, Lot 3 RP 804516\r\n\r\nWe wish to make you aware
      of a number of strong objections that numerous residents of Morayfield South
      have with regard to the proposed Material Change of Use - for Local Centre Precinct
      (including day-care retail fast food, Service Station ancillary retail) \r\nThis
      application contradicts the Caboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional Activity
      Centre in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031in the following
      respects:\r\nWe strongly object to the building of a shopping centre, petrol
      service station, fast food, retail and the high density housing etc in what
      is a residential and rural residential area. \r\nWe object to the destruction
      of the healthy urban ecosystem these lots and this area has, this part of Morayfield
      South is typical of an older rural residential area, as well as having large
      densities of mature large trees and occasional watercourse it is also home to
      a wide variety of native bird and wildlife. \r\nKoalas, many Kangaroos are often
      seen in this area.\r\nThe endangered black cockatoo and many other birds often
      feed and live in the vegetation found in the area the developers want to clear
      cut.\r\nMorayfield Souths healthy urban ecosystem is already under duress with
      the slash and burn, clear cutting of neighbouring lots but the whole suburb
      is not yet totally destroyed. \r\nIt is not too late for MBRC to protect what
      remains by refusing applications of this sort.\r\nThe very reason why we and
      many others brought into a master planned acreage properties suburb was not
      to have what the developers and MBRC are trying to force onto us now. \r\nWe
      brought into Morayfield south for the acreage residential healthy ecosystem
      lifestyle, not high density, shopping centres, fast food and petrol stations.\r\nDestruction
      of Acreage Lifestyle and Urban Ecosystem\r\nI and many others believe MBRC should
      encourage developments to create places and spaces which meet the needs and
      provide land choices of all people (not just the destructive high density living
      developments that this application propose) are visually attractive, safe, accessible,
      functional and fully funded by the developer, be inclusive for people and wildlife,
      have their own distinctive identity which maintains our acreage properties local
      character. \r\nThe acreage properties of Morayfield South living in harmony
      with our native wild life present MBRC an incredible opportunity to protect
      and commercially promote this unique type of lifestyle and accommodation choices.\r\nHow
      many suburbs do you know of close to amenities in MBRC area that still have
      Koala's, kangaroos, Echidna, Bandicoots along with masses of native birds on
      their properties daily? \r\nAll which are protected species by law!\r\nBut what’s
      the point of protecting the species if council doesn't protect the habitat they
      need to survive.\r\nIf the proposed development went ahead as planned our lifestyle
      and the area’s wildlife habitat would be lost forever to the detriment of us
      and our future generations! \r\nWe believe this application proposal to contravene
      MBRC own guidance as it is to the detriment of the quality, character and amenity
      value of our suburb. \r\nCouncil have an obligation to plan our suburbs considering
      all aspects of that suburb including its wildlife and the residents that actually
      live there. \r\nNot just the developer who lives nowhere near the slum they
      propose.\r\nThe close dealing MBRC councillors and employees have with the companies
      concerned with the destruction of Morayfield South does nothing to restore the
      public’s confidence that all applications concerning Morayfield South are without

      GP surgeries, shops, vets, supermarkets and restaurants along with a vast amount
      of vacant commercial property for sale/ lease or unoccupied in the Morayfield
      Cabooltures service centre, the alleged demand for more retail and commercial
      properties is not warranted. Another petrol station is defiantly not warranted
      especially one built next to people’s homes.\r\nThe closing of the large Caboolture
      Sand and Gravel site at 369 Morayfield road and its development into more commercial
      activities has also added to the already ample supply of commercial activity
      in this area. \r\nIt is important to note that one of the new businesses to
      open at 369 Morayfield road is yet another petrol service station. This service
      station will be only 2.5km less than a 3 minute drive from the proposed development.
      Morayfield south currently has three petrol service stations with retail outlets
      all within a 2.5 to 2.9 km from 293-285 Oakey Flat Road.\r\nApproving the building
      of a shopping centre, fast food, petrol station in this bushland residential
      area is not only totally not needed, but out of place with the suburb and also
      a vast injustice to the current business owners who have taken the risk and
      invested in and started their business within the boundaries of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre under the belief that commercial activity
      and therefore the concentration of their clients would be confined within the
      Caboolture-Morayfield Principal Regional Activity Centre.\r\nThe Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre also has the existing transport and infrastructure
      to cater for these types of commercial activities already in place.\r\nThere
      are currently 18 service stations serving the Caboolture/Morayfield area the
      furthest away from the proposed sited are the two service stations on Beerburrum
      Road at only 5.3km an approximate 9 minute drive. The three closest service
      stations are only a mere 2.5 km and 2.9 km away approximately 3 minutes’ drive.
      The other Eightteen service stations are spread between Caboolture, the Bruce
      Hwy and Morayfield commercial district less than 5km away with yet another opened
      on Uhlmann road.\r\nThere is also the three service stations at Burpengary tower
      shopping centre as well only 6km away or 7 minute drive.\r\nThe developer’s
      claims that the area needs more commercial properties are unjustified, with
      the Woolworths Aldi Supa Centre only 2.6 km less than 3minutes. With BCF, Bunnings,
      Goodguys and many more commercial activities also the same distance away. \r\nMinor
      Convenience shopping is adequately supplied with convenience shopping available
      at the corner of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road, Seven 11 and BP and other shops
      less than 3 minutes away.\r\nThe owners of the independent shops at the corner
      of and Oakey Flat and Nairn road have invested in serving the community for
      over 20 years, the destruction of their livelihood and reduction in consumer
      choice by allowing the large commercial retail such as Coles and Woolworths
      to force the smaller independent retailer out of business and then price gouging
      us by increasing prices due to no competition is a crime.\r\n Small local retail
      Competition is essential to us the residents of Morayfield south for our economic
      prosperity. Small independent business, competing against retail giants such
      as Coles and Woolworths have no chance of survival.\r\nYet Retail space devoted
      to food sales in the Caboolture Morayfield Burpengary has hit a record high
      with multiple shopping centres opened recently in the areas Principal Regional
      Activity Centre along Morayfield and Station road.\r\nDepartment stores such
      as Myers & David Jones followed the same strategy in the last decade, and now
      they are closing stores and filing for bankruptcy at staggering rates.\r\nThe
      Caboolture Morayfield area has one on Australia’s largest population of obese
      adults and children, it would be morally wrong for MBRC to approve any junk
      fast food outlet in any rural and residential area.\r\nThe last thing this area
      needs is any form is a service station or junk fast food outlets; the roads
      and waterways in our area are already used as dumping points for wrappings and
      rubbish from the nearby fast food outlets on Morayfield Rd thrown from cars
      and pedestrians littering our footpaths and properties.\r\n\r\nThe anti-social
      and criminal behaviour that these types of commercial centres attract is also
      something that this residential area does not want, commercial centres of this
      nature need to be kept within the boundaries of the Morayfield Caboolture Activity
      Centre where proper policing of these areas is achieved more efficiently and
      cost effectively by police services.\r\nThe purpose of planning and listing
      certain areas to set aside for retail and commercial properties in the Morayfield
      Caboolture Activity Centre plan was to stop the ugly retail sprawl into residential
      areas and to centralise multiple retail activities making access to those services
      and for the clients to those retail areas easier and safer. And most importantly
      making the servicing of these businesses efficient and safer, no one wants to
      live next door to a petrol service station along with the associated risks and
      pollution a petrol service station will bring to a place where people live sleep
      and make their home. \r\nMBRC need to consider the considerable risk and disturbance
      of having large petrol tankers and supermarket semi-trailers using residential
      roads to deliver their products. \r\nThe proposed site is already within easy
      walking distance to the existing shopping complex Morayfield Supa Centre. Therefor
      the need for another retail/commercial centre is totally unnecessary for Morayfield
      south. Our area is already served by a multitude of commercial and retail choices
      along Moarayfeild road as well as a local owned independent IGA close by at
      the intersection of Oakey Flat Road and Nairn road. \r\nThe purpose of the Caboolture-Morayfield
      Principal Regional Activity Centre plan was to keep commercial activity and
      potentially dangerous commercial business centralised. \r\nTo allow this development
      to go ahead is a clear contradiction of that plans purpose. \r\nMany areas within
      the Regional Activity Centre of Caboolture and Morayfield north are much more
      suited for developments of this nature.\r\nPlease consider the valid reasons
      raised and reject the application Development Application \r\n 36729\r\n\r\nKind
      regards\r\nC Jones\r\nLot 91 SP 200423 Morayfield\r\n"

        Hi Tiffany



        Thanks for your  e mail - I’m not aware of this so proposal so thank you for raising it.



        I have asked the CEO to investigate & provide an response.



        I have been closely watching the work on the SA Water tank site as I’m very concerned about the disturbance to the wildlife habitat there – plus that the trees that koalas use on the site remain accessable to them.



        Kind regards

        Hi Tiffany

        The matter of management of vegetation on state owned land is problematic – se e mail below.

        It seems from COB staff that the tree was removed prior to the current work being undertaken.

        Please let me know if you have any further concerns.

        Kind regards

        Dear Jane

        Thanks for the email. As the email from Tiffany has come through the planning portal we are unable to correspond back via email directly.

        We can confirm that there are no recent Development Applications; this is primarily because the work being undertaken is State Government maintenance therefore exempt from such processes.

        However, there was an approval for the removal of a Regulated Tree from the property approximately four years ago. The tree was a Eucalyptus Saligna (Sydney Blue Gum).  The location of the tree is described by our independent arborist as being in the north eastern corner of the property.

        We cannot ascertain 100 per cent from our resources that the tree has been removed.

        Following the Planning Alerts link used by the inquirer it confirms the DA she is interested is from 2014 (180\1169\14).  Assuming her search is a recent one there is a reasonable change chance the tree in question is already gone.

        Cheers
        Rob

        Can you please advise what is proposed for tree removal at the site at 9 Rodger Ave Leabrook? Has a tree removal been approved?

    text: "I have reviewed the DA and seems like \"favourable\" report for development.
      \ \r\nTo this point our family was disgusted last year with a two storey dwelling
      constructed 1.2 metres off the wall of our home in Dunmore Street, East Toowoomba,
      which had an adverse impact on a number of attributes; but at least it was a
      dwelling and not a unit development like many others.  We were so disgusted
      we bought another home in Eymard Street, which will be affected by this new
      development.\r\nI recognise that local councillors are basically powerless to
      stop the state overlays and development.  But it seems that the system is pro-development
      and I am constantly reminded to get on board in my roll as a local property
      valuer.  As I have said before many times, such development places additional
      pressure on our local existing amenities such as schools, parks, day care &
      heath facilities and these will all require additional funds to manage and upgrade
      into the future.  I would suggest that our local councillors start to develop
      a town plan for the Toowoomba residents and start to represent our concerns
      rather than blaming the state overlays.\r\nFurther to this, Toowoomba should
      not be developed like Brisbane.  To this point, this is why we reside in Toowoomba
      and not a capital city.  If you inhibit the growth in a residential area, by
      unwanted development, you will eventually stagnate it.\r\nPerhaps council should
      engage some local valuers to get some insight on trends and issues, rather than
      the pro-development movement.\r\nAgain we are powerless to stop development
      and likely to move again."

        David,

        If you wish to lodge a formal objection I would encourage you to get in touch with us on 9298 8000. In terms of parking, the regulations surrounding this are State Government mandated and forcing extra parking beyond these regulations on developers is not possible though we may like to. With ever increasing population there is a responsibility and direction from state government that the increase is spread across the city and each area must have ways to deal with it. In Knox we have areas to which you refer to keep our residential areas mainly single and dual occupancy with allowance from some townhouses on bigger blocks by allowing apartments and bigger developments in areas along main roads, which are located within transport hubs (smart bus, railway stations etc) or Major activity centers like Burwood Hwy opposite Westfield. By doing that we are directing higher density development to which you refer to those areas and easing pressure on our residential areas. As times change and the number of people in Australia and especially Victoria grow, we too must grow, it is inevitable. But Knox has very strong local planning policies and plans in place that allow us to maintain our green and leafy vibe whilst allowing for growth.

      I moved here 2 1/2 years ago and I am a owner of a townhouse.\r\nI have a young
      family and children that attends the nearest public school and daycare. I catch
      public transport and my wife drives.\r\nMy issue is, infrastructure, it's at

      (which plays up rainy days, ie smell).\r\nUntil this is 'caught-up', we need
      less replacing single house with multiple dwellings. Nearly every time a house
      is bought in Oak Park (and surrounding Suburbs) it's knocked down and replaced

      and you really don't care? This area was totally flattened, no trees left standing,
      what is you Koala management plan, do you have one? Where are the wildlife corridors,
      they don't exist with out trees and green space. What do you have planed to
      limit the stress on the Koalas during construction? What impact study have you

    text: 'I too have significant concerns relating to the number of residential developments
      in and surrounding the Waterford suburb and no information was provided by the
      council when I questioned about what infrastructure is going to at least maintain
      the already limited living standards for residents in this area. There is already
      a significant and increasing amount of traffic congestion for example on the
      single lane roads. I am querying also, the lack of representation of council
      in our suburb and wondering if Waterford overall will be a sacrificial suburb.
      The whole area needs to be re-examined before further small lot development
      takes place. '

    text: "My understanding of the height of any developments should be limited to
      5 storeys. Surely this development is not going to pass any assessment. Why
      would this developer believe that this proposal would be feasible? \r\nAnother
      factor is the significance of Wharf Shed 1 (Fishermen's Wharf Market building)
      being the only such structure in the inner harbour. A developer with vision
      and respect for our maritime heritage and historic buildings would consider
      a way to use this structure as a foundation for development rather than demolish
      it. \r\nThe location of this site is important for public access along the river.
      Surely, there is going to be enough housing with other development that this
      site could be better used e.g. art gallery, restaurant/bistro/wine bar, cinema,
      Indigenous space to tell the history of the first people in Port Adelaide. "

    text: The Port Adelaide Precinct Plan gives guidance to a 5 storey limit. This
      document was community informed and should be acknowledged in planning processes
      or are we dudded yet again by government so called "consultation"? How do current
      developers feel when inappropriate development is sought adjacent to areas where
      they have undergone more stringent scrutiny? Port Adelaide is finally experiencing
      positive change with acknowledgement of its heritage assets and this North Parade
      Development kicks us back again to darker times. This construct will kill the

    text: We have nothing we were promised when we purchased our block. No playground
      in the park. No standard trees on nature strip. Certain street lamps.  We were
      told only a few limited high market units clusters for retirees. We were also
      told and shown artists impressions of the street scape and told all homes  would
      be of a similar value and size. This is a chaotic subdivision. Ppl that purchased
      were mislead. There has not been equality in the approval process. We have difficulties
      getting out of our drive. We have no line of sight and are at times blocked
      in. I have to walk the pram on the road as many residents park over the footpath.
      Why hasn't council enforced visitor parking for every unit and enough residential
      parking. Why have they allowed units to cut extra driveways. It is such a messy  disorganized
      subdivision which should have been up something like mount Pleasant estate.
      The same draftsman has copied and pasted his designs from one block to the next.
      Right now as I type there are six cars parked across the street frontage of
      62 and 64 legges. This is not what we paid for.

    text: "The proposed development is a prime example of overdevelopment. It has
      a number of shortcomings:\r\n\r\na) Four stories is too high for this street,
      which is comprised almost completely of one and two storey residential buildings.
      \ \r\nb) 13 dwellings suggests, once again, one and two bedroom flats rather
      than family-sized apartments.\r\nc) Reduction of parking will add to congestion
      problems in Harding and adjacent streets. Where will residents and customers
      of the proposed retail establishments park?  They will park in the street.  This
      has not only congestion but safety issues if the retail are not shops but say
      eateries operating at night.\r\nd See above.  What type of retail is being put
      forward?  \r\ne) Given previous experience, the design of said building is likely
      to pay little or no attention to fitting in with the existing streetscape and
      built environment.\r\nf) Where is there provision for green or open space for
      the proposed residents?\r\nh) What about affordable housing?  Will this be addressed?\r\n\r\nAs
      a long-term resident of Coburg, I am familiar with Harding Street.  I do not
      oppose redevelopment of the site but what is proposed seems to be completely
      over-the-top.  Perhaps an ambit bid? \r\n"

        Dear Phoebe,

        I am not sure why you have sent this email to me. I am not your Ward Councillor, nor am I a member of the Planning Committee? I do however very much understand your concern and we as  a Council have made a request to the State Government to change the development plan so as to disallow such development happening, we wait.
        I have Cc’d your Ward Councillors.

        Kind regards

        Bruce

      can only assume this is a corrupt deal as the property in question is a property
      development application. So some strange process is being used to avoid having
      this brought to public attention because many people will object to it.\r\nIt
      is not right that some people can do what ever they want but others can not
      even build a shed larger than 500 square meters on their own property. What
      in the hell is going on here. Property developers can knock over all their trees
      but other people have to replace their trees with 2 or 3 or 4 or more trees
      depending on the size of the tree they knock down. I obviously have not paid
      my bribe."

    text: "I am writing to express my dismay and strong objection to the proposed
      development in Northumberland road, a few minutes' walk form my home in Gaffney
      Street. While I support medium density development, this proposal for 73 dwellings
      on such a small site has so many flaws it is hard to see it would be even considered
      at all. The small size of apartments, the lack of sustainable parking (proximity
      to the station alone does not remove most people's need for a car for many other
      activities),  and traffic congestion in surrounding streets will have a significant
      negative effect on residents in the area. Regardless of the zoning, this location
      is a quiet, fairly narrow residential street and this proposed development would
      be completely out of character.\r\nAs other people have observed, the 7 storey
      proposal may be a strategy on the part of the developer to try and get 5 or
      6 storeys approved as some kind of compromise, but this still would not be acceptable.
      In this area, medium density dwellings can work well at 2-3 storeys but going
      up to 5-7 with such small tightly packed dwellings is a completely different
      matter. \r\nI urge you to do everything you can to prevent this development
      going ahead. \r\nKind regards, Sally Warmington."

      of this area.\r\n\r\nHere is how the decision to proceed with this development
      will blatantly contravene this planning overlay: \r\n\r\n1. OBJECTIVE: To implement
      the Moreland Neighbourhood Centres Strategy, 2017. RESULT: FAILED. Page 34 of
      this document clearly restricts this area to 4 storey MAXIMUM development. \r\n\r\n2.
      OBJECTIVE: To ensure built form outcomes are appropriate to the context of Moreland’s
      Neighbourhood Centres. RESULT: FAILED. As this is open for interpretation, I
      will refer you to the overwhelming response AGAINST this development you have
      received from rate-paying residents. Disregarding the community's view is just
      disrespectful.\r\n\r\n3. OBJECTIVE: To improve the quality of higher density
      and mixed use developments by providing appropriate built form guidance. RESULT:
      FAILED.  Car stacker system is suitable only for occasional use by residents.
      This will almost certainly NOT be the case. Again, you're not considering the
      context of the location and way of life in the area.\r\n\r\n4. OBJECTIVE: To
      improve amenity outcomes for residents in higher density and mixed use developments
      and for residents in adjacent buildings. RESULT: FAILED. I'm sure the adjacent
      properties would strongly disagree their amenity would be improved by this joke
      of an application. The road is TOO NARROW to service any more traffic as it
      is. The Schools in the area are AT CAPACITY. The train line is AT CAPACITY during
      peak hours before it is even stops at Pascoe Vale. Devon Road and Gaffney Street
      remain the ONLY ROUTES for traffic coming off Pascoe Vale road and are NOT SUFFICIENT
      to deal with the load ALREADY. This is made worse by the ancient level crossings
      at both intersections. \r\n\r\n5. OBJECTIVE: To ensure that new development
      makes a positive contribution to the public realm. RESULT: FAILED. Reduced quality
      of life for existing residents is not a positive contribution. \r\n\r\nI would
      hope some of the above points make their way into the logical approval process
      next time. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I will remain disappointed by absence of
      considerate planning Moreland is continually subjected to. \r\n"

    text: I have lived on this street for 12 years. With more and more units being
      built, the street parking has become overcrowded and has made it difficult and
      extremely dangerous to enter/exit our driveway and navigate down the narrow
      street. This proposal is ludicrous! This is a residential area so why can anything
      higher than 3 storeys even be considered?! Besides the fact this building would
      be an eyesore, and create further parking chaos on our street, I have significant
      concerns about the impact on other local community services. Schools and child
      care centres in the area are already at full capacity with large waiting lists,
      it is already difficult to get car parking at the only decent local supermarket
      and it is impossible to get an appointment with local health services (ie. GP’s).
      I strongly oppose this building development.

    text: Another step back for Pascpe Vale. The rates from Pascoe Vale have been
      sucked dry by Moreland City council for decades in favour of Brunswick and surroundings
      suburbs. Worst thing that ever happened to Pascoe Vale was the amalgamation
      of councils in 1994. The lack of public development on local infrastructure
      in Pacoe Vale has lead to this dire situation I feel sorry for the local residents
      and I sure am glad I don’t live there anymore. Even the Pascoe Vale pool has
      no funds alocated for improvements under the newly voted ongoing aquatic strategy.
      Get out while you still can because the only developement you will be seeing
      in the next 10 years is more of this! It says so in the state governments planning
      strategy brunwick, coburg and werribee are the allocated public growth areas
      so unless Pascoe Vale renounces it’s membership to moreland city council your
      rates are going straight to Brunswick and coburg!

    text: "Yes, we feel your pain Northumberland Rd residents. The west side of your
      street has been zoned RGZ2 (Growth Zone) due to it being within a few hundreds
      meters of PV Station. Never mind that the neighbourhood is totally removed from
      the station and is (or was) firmly low density suburban.\r\n\r\nWhile not ignoring
      Council planning on individual developments, I do think we need to turn our
      attention to our State Gov which I recall from the re-zoning meetings a few
      years ago were the main drivers for pushing medium (high) density living on
      us. This is happening all over Melbourne, although it seems to be particularly
      exacerbated in PV and Glenroy. Personally I would like to see a push for the
      development of regional centers with appropriate industry, infrastructure and
      transport investment rather than turning Melbourne's suburbs into an apartment
      tower jungle.\r\n\r\nLets see what John and Oscar have to say on the current
      State Gov policies as they are now both running as Independents for the next
      State election in Nov. We need a shakeup in PV from being an evermore safe Labour
      seat and hence ignored by both parties. I urge all concerned residents to question
      John, Oscar, sitting member Lizzie Blandthorn and other candidates as to their
      positions on the current zoning.\r\n\r\nLets get informed and make a push for
      an informed change in November. \r\n\r\nRegards to all"

      push through a 5 storey development so starting way above  at 7 storeys in order
      to 'compromise'.\r\n\r\nI will be doing a letterbox drop of the area tomorrow,
      and ensuring ALL locals are aware of this application. There are 103 carparks
      cited for 73 dwellings; with stackers. How many of the residents of this development
      will actually use the stackers? Case studies in other built up areas have shown
      they do not work and residents choose to avoid them. There is no supermarket
      within close walking distance, and all residents WILL own cars. \r\n\r\nThere
      are no other comparable developments in this area, with the max height being
      3 storeys. This should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nJohn, can you please arrange a

      of problems like leaf litter in spouting and threat to property as well as unwanted
      shade. The simple principle of respect is based on people having things, property,
      trees, personal space, body, feelings and ideas. The act of hurting or damaging
      anything people have is a disrespect. People should be able to do what they
      want with their own property provided they do not cause grief to others where
      that grief is equivalent to a disrespect. The issue then becomes how much harm
      this tree is causing the owners compared to how much neighbours loose from the
      tree being removed. Just the visual appearance should not be a consideration
      or greeny values should not be a consideration.\r\nI say allow them to remove

        Hi John,

        Thank you for the email, I have confirmed that there is an application. I have updated the Planning Alerts website, however it does not seem to be designed for the South Australian Planning system.

        The application is for a (modest) single storey addition to the existing dwelling, a new rear verandah and internal renovations.

        Unfortunately, our Access to Development Documentation Policy prevents us from sending out a copy of the plans.  However, the plans are able to be viewed here at the Civic Centre after completing a Plan Search application:

        https://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/Planning-Business/Planning-Development/Development-Applications/Development-Application-Information/Plan-Search-Application

        Alternatively, subject to the relationship, you could contact the neighbour directly.

        In 2016 the State Government made further changes to the Development process. It removed the then only 3 Councillors from the Development Assessment Panel and replaced them with 1 Councillor on the new Council Assessment Panel. Councillors have no authority in planning decisions.

        I trust this is of assistance.

        Kind regards

        Peter Cornish
        Councillor
        City of Burnside

      but would ruin the whole layout. It's a crazy idea. Why are we so obsessed with

      just be left alone. This is one of them.

        Good evening Peter,
        I have the plans attached for the ROL so you can the two new blocks are in front of the existing house.
        Unfortunately the new owners , whether we agree with it or not, have the right to sub divide when in accordance with the Redlands City Plan.
        I do agree with you concerning the character of Redlands being valued and protected but when a development is according to the City Plan there are no grounds to prevent it going ahead.

        Warm regards

        Hi Kathy and Mark,
        Lovely to hear from you.
        The State have brought in a new planning act which all Queensland councils must now use when they initiate a new planning scheme. We did that back in 2015. Unfortunately with the new town plan we had to zone land as Urban or Rural. The old Special Residential that we used to have in the old planning scheme was no longer available. Minimum size for Rural Res is 3000m2. All the blocks around you are around 2000. Some smart consultants have got onto this fact and are going around trying to get people to subdivide or some smart developers are going around buying blocks cheap and then applying to council to divide their blocks in two. There has been another on in Amanda Jane recently.
        As a suburban block the minimum size is 600m2 so technically all the blocks in the Gainbrae area could be subdivided. Looking at the map though only a very few are in the position to as they have houses and garages etc that would make the exercise uneconomical.
        I've attached a pic for you so you can this is mainly the case. The one on the corner just happened to be lucky in the way the positioned their house originally.
        I'll have a chat with the Manger of Planning Services and see if there is any avenue for you to pursue.
        Best wishes,
        Mick

        Hi Kathy and Mark,



        Further to my email last week I’ve received advice from our Manager of Development Services which I have included below.



        “Your summary is correct.   In our investigation on this from memory only 4 or so blocks would be likely given existing houses.   However to ensure this doesn’t occur an amendment to the scheme could be pursued to have a no further reconfiguration criteria added for this area?”



        So far only two have been lodged.  If you want to pursue this further can you please send me a letter signed by yourselves and some of the other neighbours and I will push this through Council and see if we can get this in one of Council’s future Planning Scheme Amendments.



        Best wishes,

        Mick

        Hello Anne,

        Could you let me know if you receive my reply via the PlanningAlerts page. I have not used it before. Do you have a copy of the Body Corporate regulations that may prevent use of the apartment as short stay?

        Dear Mrs Clarke,

        I’d certainly hope so, in relation to any donations or gifts!  That you would see fit the need to add this to your letter is a concern about your perception of Hobart City Council Aldermen.  Nonetheless, if the by-laws of your Body Corporate prohibits leasing in such terms, then this becomes a civil legal matter for the body corporate to ultimately decide, regardless of any planning decision outcome.  I would be raising this matter very strongly with your body corporate committee.  People sometimes make the mistake of getting planning permission and then thinking they will persuade the body corporate.

        Kind regards,
        Alderman Dr Eva Ruzicka
        Hobart City Council

    text: "To Local Councillors and Planning Authority.\r\nOnce again a developer

      into a small area. This development is  for 3 double storey townhomes on what
      is classified in Olde Berwick as an \"Avenue of Honor\". The removal of a large
      amount of trees and removal of almost any surface area of the land for rainfall
      uptake is detrimental to the area's quality of canopy trees and green spaces.
      Please review this application seriously as the addition of three low cost dwellings
      intended for quick sale will negatively impact the local character, traffic
      and endanger the local landscape.\r\nThank you for taking the time to reconsider

      have to dodge parked cars each side of streets as there is more than one car
      to each house or units built in backyards and only one garage for each house
      or units built.  It is getting quite dangerous driving in and out of the parked
      cars with traffic coming towards you. The areas are now becoming so built up
      that we no longer have a lovely quite country feel and it is getting worse.
      I thought our local council was looking after us and was supportive of no houses
      or units to be built in backyards but evidently that has changed, sadly. We
      a have  tiny two story house built right in the corner of our corner back fence
      and we can hear every noise made as if they are in our house and backyard especially
      there barking dog which they leave home in the tiny none exsistent backyard
      while they work, very sad. \r\n"

    text: Dear Linda, thank you for your comments to clarify the situation, and I'm
      sure that all users appreciate the owners of the blocks letting us use them
      appropriately. As a long term Brinsmead resident and very regular user of the
      area in question (for dog walking and fitness purposes) I would hope that it's
      not simply a matter of Council considering the development in view of it having
      long term zoning approval, but considering the application in terms of what
      is right and appropriate for your constituents today. It would be a huge loss
      if this area was developed as is currently proposed, and with the number of
      people I see who use the track on a regular basis, I'm sure many would feel
      this way. Green areas such as this are part of the character of Brinsmead, and
      I second those who say that there are way too many proposed lots. Can the council
      not do the same here as they did for Earl Hill? MTB is huge in Cairns, it has
      saved a town in Tassie by bringing MTB tourists into the area, and I've never
      had or seen an issue in sharing the area with MT Bike riders or other users.
      This area is so well patronised by locals, as well as being easy to access,
      it would be a huge loss to see some or all of it developed. I treasure the walks
      through the forest with my dog, it's so peaceful and beautiful there. Despite
      the usage, I frequently see wildlife in the area. It's also one of the few bike
      and walking tracks around that are largely litter free and this is a credit
      to the community that uses it. It's a shame I can't say the same for the open
      paddock near the road, which is - very sadly - a tip. FInally, in such a steep
      area, with many gullies and ridges, I would question how this amount of housing
      is deemed suitable for an area like that? How will you ensure the developer
      meets or exceeds the environmental conditions and considerations. I realise
      the development, like all in your area, will be subject to T&Cs, however how
      will you manage the compliance with them in practice? There's a significant
      amount of water that comes down that hill in the wet season.

        concerns for this proposed development. As this application has only just
        been lodged I am yet to be briefed by Planners on the full application. However,
        this land has always been zoned for development (way before my time) and has
        been privately owned by the same family who owned most of that area in Brinsmead
        for generations. The current use of the land for dog walking/bike trails etc
        has been an informal use and is actually trespassing on private property,
        which the owners have never had an issue with. I have lived in the area for
        more than 20 years and my boys grew up riding on that parcel of land as well,
        but the fact is (as sad as it is) the owners of the land have always had a
        right to submit a development application for it. They own the land from Brinsmead
        Road and the property extends back to approximately 500 metres up the hill,
        where it then abuts on to another private block of land. From a visual perspective
        I know that it looks like this is all part of one big reserve that local residents
        have used but it is, in reality, private land. As much as I personally would
        love to have this retained as a vegetated reserve, there are no legal reasons
        of how Council can stop this from happening. \n\nI'm more than happy to talk
        to you further about it so if you're okay for me to call you can you please
        send me through a contact phone number.\n\nKind regards,\n\nLinda\n\n\nCr

    text: To Councilor Darren Power - All road noise survey's have been made from
      Bryants Road the driveway for this Centre is in Timor Avenue. This will cause
      more parking on the street. Also as people do not wish to walk long distances
      they will park on the bend outside 72-74 Timor Avenue. This will be very dangerous
      for motorist driving in the street, it will obstruct their view and make it
      one way traffic. More traffic coming into Timor Avenue and turning in the first
      driveway on the right. When they have events (Grandparents day, Concerts etc)
      traffic and parking in a residential area will be increased, disruptive and
      dangerous.  Having staff arriving at 6am in a residential area this will not
      be quiet while people are still sleeping. .Having children playing outside from
      7am will create more noise in a residential area when people are sleeping. We
      bought our house (over 20years ago) in a residential area not commercial.  Evan
      though we are close to Bryants Road it is a very peaceful neighbourhood.

    text: "The proposed subdivision should not be approved in its present form as
      it does not comply with density requirements. \r\n\r\nThe Town Planning Report
      states the following:\r\n\r\n\"PO1 sets out that residential density must not
      exceed 11 dwellings per hectare. The site has a developable site area of 1.5165
      ha (1.011ha x 1.5). Therefore, the net residential density is 10.6 dwellings
      per hectare. As such, the proposal complies with the density requirements of
      the Suburban neighbourhood precinct\".\r\n\r\nAttention is drawn to Planning
      Scheme Policy Neighbourhood Design which states that the factor of 1.5 should
      not be used for sites with internal roads. It is noted that the proposal includes
      an internal road and, therefore, the allowable net residential density under
      PO1 of the Reconfiguring a Lot Code - Suburban neighbourhood precinct should
      be taken to be 11.12 lots (1.011ha x 1). As such, 16 lots is considered to be
      a gross overdevelopment of the site in terms of net residential density requirements.
      \r\n\r\nAttention is also drawn to Section 8.1 of the Policy, which further
      demonstrates how net density is to be calculated in the Suburban neighbourhood
      precinct. Again, the proposed development has a net density of 16 lots per hectare,
      which is gross overdevelopment.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that PO1 allows for net density
      to be exceeded only where lots are are consistent with the low density and established
      character of the surrounding neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Town Planning Report
      claims that the proposal also complies with this aspect of PO1, by making reference
      to previously approved developments in Albany Creek. It is noted that both of
      these developments proposed minimum lot sizes of 493m2 and 500m2, whereas this
      proposal has lots as small as 411m2. This is not consistent with the reference
      developments. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above, it is also noted that both
      of the referenced developments are on the opposite side of the South Pine River.
      While generally nearby, these developments are not considered to be in the surrounding
      neighbourhood. The surrounding neighbourhood is considered to be the local development
      on the northern side of South Pine River, in Eatons Hill, and nearby to the
      subject site. Specifically, that area bounded by Bunya Crossing Drive on the
      west, South Pine River on the South and East, and Cabarita Cres on the north.
      It is noted that there is approximately 150 lots in the surrounding neighbourhood
      as defined above, all of which range between approximately 600m2 and 800m2.
      \r\n\r\nI have not looked at every lot in the neighbourhood, but I am 99% sure
      that not a single lot is less than 600m2. The existing development pattern in
      the surrounding neighbourhood is consistent with the intent of the Planning
      Scheme and community expectations for development of the subject site.\r\n\r\nI
      am very disappointed that Council's Information Request has not raised the issue
      of lot sizes and density, as the proposal is clearly not conistent with the
      requirements of the Planning Scheme or community expectations. \r\n\r\nCouncil
      should revisit its current state of assessment of the proposal and request that
      the proposal be redesigned to comply with the relevant Performance outcome.
      At the very least, the proposal should provide lots sizes generally in the range
      of 600m2, with maybe a few as small as 500m2. As it stands, the proposal cannot
      reasonably be said to comply with the relevant Performance outcome, and should
      not be approved."

      \r\n\r\n2. Rivergum Drive is not wide enough nor is there space to widen the

      and other native wildlife which will have their habitat further  destroyed if

      building under this proposal will be replaced by a seven storey monstrosity.
      Apart from creating a visual eye sore, it is a case of gross over development.
      \r\nAn absolute minimum car parking requirement is 90 spots, for the proposed
      45 apartments, including 9 three bedroom dwelling. In a complete disregard for
      regulations the developers are proposing to build 7 story when only 5 is required
      by law. Surely, this alone should lead to the dismissal of the proposal. \r\nCouncil
      needs to commission its own independent traffic report, this one does not correspond
      to my personal experience of the place, where parking is at a premium and it
      is almost impossible to find a spot. \r\nWhile developers may feel that they
      have an inalienable right to gouge huge profits, this must not be at the expense
      of surrounding community and the quality of life. \r\nI feel strongly that the
      present proposal must be completely rejected and an alternative, more modest
      proposal made that conforms to the laws\r\nWe need a whole lot more than token
      gestures related to sustainability and heritage. There are good examples around
      - we don't need to reinvent the wheel. We just need developers to accept there

    text: "I don't agree with this further development of the land for a number of
      \ reasons which I will outline below : \r\nROADS\r\nBetween this and the 81
      additional lots on the otherside of Mahoney road proposed last month there is
      insufficient road network to support it. Mahoney road itself is a dangerous
      enterance on an already notoriously bad  spot on the MT Lindsey hwy where a
      number of lives have been taken in recent years. \r\n\r\nSCHOOLS \r\nThe local
      schools are already at bursting point with many of the facilities unable to
      cope with the pressure. Parking is dangerous and buildings are full of asbestos.
      Our children are not safe and overcrowding an already overwhelmed  small school
      will only create greater risk.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY \r\nFrom what I've heard most
      of the community do not wish to be surrounded by urbanised development in rural
      areas. Just because the town plan says you can have a 4000sqm block doesn't
      mean you should! Rural life should mean having a pony or enjoying a dirt bike
      not packing in 100's of houses to serve the profitability of the development.
      The council amalgamation and the new town plan was thrust upon us and now our
      way of life is in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT \r\nThis area and surrounding
      locations are marked as high risk environmental areas by state government with
      a possibility of endangered and vulnerable species of flora and fauna. I know
      koalas are located in the region. I don't want to see the land for wildlife
      program I've worked so hard for destroyed in this way. \r\n\r\nNot 500 metres
      away established building envelopes, provide to secure Conservation pathways
      are at risk of relaxation for an extra council fee..... \r\n\r\nFinally and
      perhaps most importantly It is not right that a landowner who is being investigated
      for unlawful clearing and environmental harm for the sites that neighbour  this
      land should be rewarded in this way when the previous issue remains outstanding.
      It is not right! \r\n\r\nState government may make the laws but the council
      get to admister these decisions. Please speak for our environment and our lifestyle!
      \r\n\r\nMy family don't want this here leave our way of life alone !"

    text: As the owner of the site I understand that there is  some concern as to
      the disturbance of the vegetation at the proposed placement site of the tower.
      I would be happy to show any interested member of the council the site as the
      vegetation comprises large amounts of introduced species such as a heavy infestation
      of Lantana and foreign grasses which need to be eradicated. The canopy above
      has several non indigenous trees which have no benefit to the area. While being
      mindful of the absolute need for caution in disturbing any native flora the
      small area required the area described (144 square metres) in my opinion will
      have little or no effect on any significant species.

      the potential detriment it would cause to Edward and Lygon streets and, Brunswick
      East and people who actually live here.  Day in, day out, we don''t want to
      see this development and have to suffer the consequences of the added pressures
      of traffic, no parking, no light, graffiti and filth and a building that is
      certainly not in line with the surroundings and heritage architecture.  It''s
      appalling and if it goes ahead, we can thank our elected councilors for nothing

    text: Moreland, please listen. I am tired of writing over and over again. These
      huge constructions along what was once a familiar, slow-paced, easily accessible
      inner city landscape with small shops in quaint heritage buildings is totally
      killing our neighbourhood. Killing it—totally. We did not vote this council
      in to create a shopping mall along our quieter end of lygon Street. Giant, cold,
      wind tunnels, unpleasant facades, dark, cold streets, million more cars......
      We don't want this anymore. Stop now.

      of developer greed, creating more rumours of Council collusion. Other areas
      like Kruger and Moggill have new developments that include sizable blocks with
      green zones and playing fields, so the Ipswich Council argument that development
      of Bellbird Park into a rabbit warren is forced onto them by the State Government,
      is a huge misrepresentation. The current planning scheme for Bellbird Park has
      no concern for the future or the well being of the current residents.\r\nThe
      'fair go' it seems applies only to those with power."

      Strata Residential l regulation purposely states they are non-applicable to

      insurance levies associated with a hotel business model. So isn't it a case

      indicates that the minimum residential stay is six months. No question. Black

      the building does not permit short term accommodation. So my point is what were
      the conditions in which this building was purchased. If this building is ever

      with the systematic destruction of yet more wildlife habitat beggars belief.
      Approvals for development on the coast has gone through the roof and we genuinely
      run the risk of losing this amazing environment we call home. As a wildlife
      nurse at the hospital this news upsets and affects me greatly - we are destroying

        Good morning Mara.
        Thanks for your email.
        This development was approved by the Planning and Environment Courts some years ago.   Council refused the application but the Courts over ruled.   I am working hard to not have the extension approved and thus the application may lapse.
        Regards.  Jenny

    text: How many people have supported this development? How many were opposed?
      Why would development be allowed in an area well known for flooding? We have
      a beautiful creek passing by that floods quite fast. We have roads already that
      falling apart and cannot carry the amount of people we already have coming inannd
      out of town. To come out of jubilee drive is just dangerous when trying to go
      back into town or vice Versa. Maybe it’s time a meeting is held in the hall
      for it to be talked about. What wild life will be left homeless once the trees
      are knocked down?

        Good morning Michelle.
        Thanks for your email.   This development was refused by Council some years ago.
        The matter was taken to the Planning and Environment Court where the Courts upheld the Developer. I understand they are seeking an extension and I have forward to our Planning staff regarding their “rights” with continuing to request for extensions.
        Much appreciated.   Jenny

      text: "Good morning\n\nThank you for the email.  There is a development approval
        on the site for a Multiple dwelling (comprising 55 units – ref. MCU07/0129),
        which was approved by the Planning and Environment Court in 2011. As the site
        has a lawful development approval in place, the land has been included in
        a zone that reflects the development approval (i.e. Medium density residential
        zone).  The approved development has the appearance of townhouses, and has
        been designed with the local building character in mind. Residential development
        of this type is typically preferred to be located within walking distance
        to shops, transport and the like.  In this regard, the development meets this
        outcome.\n\nIn respect to your concerns about wildlife, it is advised that
        the court approval includes conditions requiring rehabilitation of waterways
        with locally endemic plant species. It is expected that these rehabilitated
        areas will ultimately provide habitat for native fauna. It is noted that the
        site does not contain native vegetation, and no clearing will occur as a result
        of the development.\n\nThe applicant has recently applied to extend the timeframe
        in which they can carry out the development (ref. MCU07/0129.01), and is seeking
        an extension of the ‘relevant period’ by 2 years.  This request is currently
        being considered by Council, and is due for decision at the end of July 2018.\n\nShould
        you require any additional information about the development approval, please
        contact the Planning Assessment team on 5475 9801.\n\nRegards,\n\n\nCr Jenny

    text: "Hello to all the Commenters,\r\n\r\nWe are a fast-growing group of concerned
      residents from around Bellbird Park, Camira and Goodna and we recently joined
      together to protest against a proposed development at Eugene St, Bellbird Park.
      \ We each did a few small things (all by our own choice and in our own time
      and suited to our abilities).  We found that EVERYONE has something to offer
      and after doing these things, to our delight the application was REJECTED OUTRIGHT
      by Ipswich City Council.  We believe our success was due largely to people power
      and our belief that many hands make light work.  \r\nUnfortunately, the developer
      whose application was rejected, has now lodged an appeal in the Planning and
      Environment Court.  Our group plans to keep protesting against this development
      and others like it which we think do not comply with the Ipswich Planning Scheme.\r\nYou
      might have a similar, inappropriate, proposed development near your house -
      there are so many popping up all over the place.  Maybe we can even change some
      of the planning laws for the better if we all join together!!  There is no better
      time than now for us to make a change, as Ipswich City Council is about to potentially
      enter administration.  Tell us what’s been happening in your area - we can all
      help each other to make a change.  We want you know that you CAN MAKE A REAL
      DIFFERENCE!!  \r\nYou (and like-minded friends and neighbours!) can join our
      group on Facebook at\r\n \r\nStop the Development Application RAL- 4432 / 2017

    text: "I would like to also object to the proposed DA for the below listed reasons.\r\n\r\nLot
      sizes:\r\nThe proposed development is in breach of ICC Planning Scheme, a council
      owned planning scheme. The current zoning stipulates requirement for lots of
      600m2 or more and yet despite this another development proposal breaching the
      ICC Planning Scheme is lodged for consideration. This and other like developments
      devalue the existing character of the area and are detrimental to the suburb’s
      family friendly and leafy character, a criteria that should be respected and
      addressed according to ICC schemes.\r\n\r\nTraffic Impact\r\nJones Road, Rosemary
      Street, Fiona Street and other key catchment traffic corridors are already at
      their capacity level. Every allotment approved generates at least 2 car trips
      per day and or more. The current road network has already reached its capacity
      level for the area’s rapidly growing demand for road access and other allied
      services. To access any type of service, employment or education requires a
      car trip to the neighbouring areas (Springfield Central, Redbank Plains, Goodna
      and beyond).\r\n\r\nLong term planning\r\nThis and like developments highlight
      poor planning and lack of strategic vision for the area. The consequences of
      these are already felt by all residents as each is financially impacted, either
      through rising insurance premiums, traffic congestion and time required to access
      any destination outside their immediate neighbourhood. Also, there are health
      impacts resulting from rapidly decreasing open and green areas available to
      the residents and rapidly shrinking community connection torn apart by these
      aggressive, environmentally destructive practices. Deforestation, land clearance
      and destructive re-shaping of the local landforms is at odds with the Planning
      Scheme and are the signs of very poorly scoped developments. As a result, these
      developments are aggravating pressures on the community’s fabric, removing access
      to open spaces and an active lifestyle of local residents and negatively contributing
      to the overall health and wellbeing of our community. This is an outcome we,
      the residents, do not wish to have imposed upon us and our community. These
      hidden social costs will put a significant burden not on the ICC or developer
      but on individuals, families and more importantly, children and young people.
      Their upbringing and childhood will be negatively affected due to deprivation
      of minimal garden and open spaces and walking distance access to bushland and
      open spaces, a natural heritage that has defined generations of Australian communities.\r\n\r\nTraffic
      Constraints\r\nI concur with the earlier comments that a right-hand turn from
      the proposed development site to exit onto Jones Rd would be almost impossible
      and will create a significant risk of accident or injury at peak school and
      traffic hours. Also, the congestion will limit students walking access to the
      school and education facilities as it will be perceived as dangerous and risky,
      adding to an already high level of traffic congestion in the area.\r\n\r\nWith
      25 proposed allotments, the site will create at least 50 car trips during peak
      time, if not more. The social impact of this approval will be negatively felt
      beyond the estate residents, by the broader community and anyone using Jones
      Rd as their traffic corridor to access their property or services.\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\nLike
      others, I concur and object to the loss and destruction of even more koala and
      wildlife habitat. There is no price at which one can restore the total land
      clearance and environmental vandalism demonstrated by the recent developments
      in the area. A token tree left out coupled by estate naming practices “woods”,
      “forests”, “gardens” are a mockery of the ICC planning approval process. Losing
      more of the area’s flora and fauna is not acceptable and it raises serious questions
      about ICC and developers’ ability to undertake well designed urban and community
      planning on behalf of the local community and for the betterment of the community
      as per ICC planning scheme.\r\nCr Tully please stand up for Bellbird Park and
      your electorate! \r\nYour and ICC councillors’ actions speak louder than words.

      the council regulations of 600m. Wehave been residents of Bellbird  park since

      to get busier day by day it is heart breaking to see every day, bit by bit our

    text: "I object to this development application.  The proposed lot size is not
      in keeping with the local area, and the proposed stormwater infrastructure is
      unsuitable for the area given the substantial flooding that already occurs during
      rain events.  Our property in Bellbird Park has seen increased flooding of Woogaroo
      Creek since the clearing of trees for Brentwood Forest estate occurred, and
      I imagine other properties in the vicinity would be experiencing the same.  Deforestation
      is already rampant in the area, and long term residents can all attest to the
      rapid decline of local wildlife population - especially koalas that were once
      commonplace - as a direct result.  Losing more flora and fauna in an area that
      has already been savagely deforested is not acceptable.  \r\nThese types of
      subdivision proposals with small lots being created only impact the suburb negatively
      - crime rates in the last 10 years have gone up 50% (a quick check on QPS Crime
      Map website will show this information) and residents have lost their sense
      of calm and quiet.  We've gone from hearing birds chirping to chainsaws revving,
      and it's highly disturbing that developers are continued to allow to destroy
      what once was a peaceful suburb boasting large blocks of land and abundant wildlife.
      \ Brentwood 'Forest'  can hardly be called a forest...in fact residents of this
      estate are selling up and moving out because even they - the people who knowingly
      bought into a property development - can't handle seeing the devastating deforestation
      first hand after living there long enough to see the impact it has on the remaining
      wildlife.  How can anyone approve the continuance of this trend in the area?
      \ It has to stop.  Someone needs to draw a line before Bellbird Park becomes
      a concrete jungle."

    text: "I object to this DA for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Because it is in
      breach of the Ipswich Planning Scheme, as it includes lots less than 600sqm
      in size. Our suburb is quickly losing its character to small lot developments
      such as this, with nearby properties being devalued in the process.\r\n\r\n2.
      I am also concerned about the ability of Jones Rd to cope with even more traffic.
      It is already a very busy road now, used by many children accessing the new
      State High and Augusta SS. The DA relates to a parcel of land where a right
      hand turn to exit onto Jones Rd would be almost impossible at peak hours (school
      drop off and pick up) and likely to cause accidents as people become frustrated
      and take silly risks.\r\n\r\n3. I object to the loss of even more koala habitat.
      There is a sign advising people that koalas are in the area - just metres from
      this block!\r\n\r\n4. Increased run off. Happy Jack Gully flooded across Jones
      Rd for the first time that I can ever remember (I have lived here for 18 years)
      earlier this year, with debris caught up in the fence on Jones Rd. This is no
      doubt due to all the development in the area and so, more development = more
      run off.\r\n\r\nIf Council is to approve development of this block, the developers
      need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a plan that is more in
      snych with the suburb and meets the needs of existing residents and native wildlife.\r\n\r\nCr

    text: "I have not thoroughly red all the comments about this development but essentially
      they are all negative and question the councils ability to manage this and the
      councils intention to preserve the current aesthetics of the neighbourhood.\r\nI
      live on Jones road, an acre plus and purchased in the area because of the spacious
      lots and low density housing. Prior to committing to buy I contacted council
      and they assured me that the zoning was to remain the same into the future.\r\nSince
      purchasing two large blocks adjacent to mine have been sub-divided into over
      50 with more to come. Many of these are Duplex type housing that the council
      was unaware of until they were built.\r\nThe council has a \"self assessment\"
      approach to building houses which allows a great deal of exploitation. So long
      as you build within the local guidelines it is possible to build then submit
      plans AFTER construction is completed!! even if the construction breaches the
      guidelines or barely meets them council WILL NOT exercise any enforcement to
      alter the constructions.\r\nDrainage is a major issue with the area, infrastructure
      prior to the new developments was at its limit. Part of the costs incurred when
      subdividing is to pay the council for any upgrading of current infrastructure
      to handle the extra burden from new development.\r\nI have been in contact with
      Ipswich Town Planning and discussed this matter, the reply I received was that
      there was insufficient funds in the budget to allow for upgrades at this time.
      So it seems either the council is not charging developers enough to subdivide
      and prosper or they are using the funds collected for something other than what
      they were collected for.\r\nI can be contacted at trdhilux@gmail.com or 0412

      It is in a flood zone, a regular one. Storm water drainage would contribute

      submit a development in keeping with the character of Bellbird Park. Clearly
      the developers are trying on the council, trying to squeeze as many houses onto
      the location as possible. Planning schemes should be in place to protect people
      from such developments. This is clearly a try on by the developers. Our neighbourhood

      in 731sqm of land. The front unit is right in your face and is only a few metres

      Shame on you manningham councillors. Money is not everything in this world.
      The council tricked the objectors by not issuing the permit in the first place
      and when the developer appealed to vcat, we were waiting to have our day in
      court. But the council then issued the permit without notifying the objectors
      and then we heard that the permit was given. The town planner said vcat issued
      the permit, but our research revealed that the case did not make it to vcat.

      the development IF it includes MULTI-storey townhouses right beside us where
      we think 3 may be intended, as they will BLOCK OUR SOLAR PANELS for both Electricity
      AND Hot Water which we have incurred considerable expense having installed.
      I am a shift worker currently on long-term sick leave and home most of the day
      so a bit more consideration to us would have been appreciated and expected.
      Please advise.\r\nP.S. Dust from earthworks is NOT being supressed in any way
      (watered down with sprinkler system etc.) and given hubby has new work vehicle
      parked outside and we can't hang laundry on clothesline side of house now, it's
      pretty poor lack of consideration given our house (including clothesline) is
      so close to boundary fence. Please investigate and advise. Thank you.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nMargaret

    text: "I agree that formal notification AND the potential to argue the development
      plan (with serious weight, not just voice your opinion but “we don’t care as
      it meets our new planning requirements”) is needed.\r\nOur house is on the western
      side of this development, and we came home to find the house being demolished
      with no notification of it.\r\nNot only that, but we have 3!!!!!-two story town
      houses scheduled to be built on the south side of our priority too. So we are
      essentially going to be boxed in by town houses, with the ones on the southern
      side on only 235-239sqm blocks.\r\nThere should be regulations as to how many
      two-stories can be built per block.\r\n\r\nWe bought into Warradale as a spacious
      suburb to hopefully bring our future family up in, and we are now questioning
      if the oversaturaation of people, families, street traffic, and children into
      the local schools is now a viable option. And we have only been here 2 years.
      I get the feeling we will be the only 700sqm block left on our street in the
      coming years, which is very sad."

    text: A similar situation is occurring right now in Ewell Ave Warradale  where
      4 new row dwellings will soon replace a single house on a single block. These
      4 new allotments are also 'at variance' to the Councils DP. You say that Council
      is seeking approval from the Govt for a new DP, to reduce housing density.  When
      and if this new DP comes into force, developments such as these will still be
      "at variance" , just a little  more "at variance' than under the current DP.  I
      fail to see how this will prevent 4 row dwellings on a single block, or reduce
      housing density. Planners are most likely to continue to say, as they do now,
      that the developmements are "not significantly at variance". And who will stop
      them?  People are clearly fed up with the situation. It will take courage, but
      Council must step up to the plate and force change. The minimum block widths
      and area provisions in the current DP would have been enough to prevent these
      developments if only someone had enforced them. Council must take a stand, then
      fight it in the courts if necessary, because we ratepayers are not happy with
      the way planners are interpreting the DP and dictating to us.  Could you please
      copy this to Cr Nathan Prior? Thank you.

    text: "Hi Diane,\r\nThe problem lies with the plan and fundamentally in Planning
      Legaslation which is written to be flexible. It is naive to believe that all
      developments will comply completely with the plan so, what gets through and
      what gets knocked back?\r\n\r\nMarion developments must adhere to most of the
      plan and the planners (when recommending or otherwise) and members of the CAP
      must use judgement ( and historical cases in the ERD court) to determine whether
      a block has met enough of the criteria to pass or not. There is a statement
      often in the panel notes \"not at significant variance\" which means that if
      you read the limits as hard then the development does not comply but on merit
      it meets enough to pass. Bruce and I have been argueing the definition of this
      for a while now. This is also a problem of legal precedence. If one block gets
      passed at 5 m2 under the designated block area then others will argue that theirs
      should pass too. \r\n\r\nOnce again as stated above the way to get around this
      problem is to make the limits higher in the plan. Rather than a 250 limit where
      we get blocks at 220 under the \"not at significant variance\"nat clause, we
      set the new limit to 275 and get blocks closer to 250? Hence the need for a
      new plan.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you couldn't lodge an objection is an oversight
      of the current process. I believe that all affected residents should be able
      to lodge. \r\nRegarding the overshadowing, I am interested to come take a look
      at your situation there. I most likely wont be able to do anything (cant really
      move the sun or buildings....) about it but maybe I can stop something like
      that happening to someone else in the future \r\nCheers\r\n"

    text: In response to Nathan Prior's comments I disagree to his comment that the
      current plan is creating overdevelopment based on facts from experience of Marion
      Council’s approvals.  Marion Council cause over development based on facts that
      I am happy to provide. The current plan states that row dwellings in our policy
      area should be a minimum of 7m wide blocks. Therefore, 3 row dwellings should
      have a minimum block size width of 21m. Marion Council approved 3 row dwellings
      to be built on a block size of under 20m width in our street, the block size
      was approx 19.5 m therefore too narrow for this to be approved  in our narrow
      already overcrowded street already full of parked cars that we have been complaining
      about for more then 2 years. l disputed the development as it didn't meet Marion
      Council’s block sizes in the current plan to be told firstly that I couldn't
      lodge an objection as it didn't require me to be publicly notified even though
      I live across the road from this development and secondly that the' 7m block
      with per row dwelling is just a guide'. So for Marion Council to use the State
      Government and current plan as an excuse for over development for them to deflect
      responsibility is misleading the public. Secondly,  Marion Council have overshadowing
      policies which from my experience they don't follow either.  Then after the
      fact when your home is overshadowed we are told they aren't going to do anything
      about something they approved.

    text: "Hi All, \r\nThere are a few things to consider here and I will try not
      to write an essay...... although this often deserves it. This is a general statement
      about the current state of play, not specifically about this development.\r\n\r\nRegarding
      the policy, Marion Council is responsible for setting the policy and the State
      Government then gets to amend and approve to make it official. This gives them
      the power to overrule anything we try to do to reduce densities. \r\nOnce the
      policy is set and approved by the Stage Gov, the CAP will measure proposed developments
      on how they fit within the policy and there is very little that the local councillors
      can do about this. At best, represent in the CAP meeting but in my experience
      this achieves only minor corrections to plans.  \r\n\r\nThe current plan is
      allowing this overdevelopment and there is nothing we can do about it except
      submit another development plan to the minister........ Which is what we have
      been working on in Marion to the point that we recently submitted a city wide
      plan to the State Government, one where we have tried to reduce densities in
      problem areas in the council. So far we have not had a reply, \r\n\r\nIn a bigger
      picture view, I actually think that we are going about this the wrong way in
      the higher density areas too. Making smaller and smaller blocks is not the answer.
      I would prefer to see apartment style living with undercroft parking and shared
      services around our major infrastructure. At least trying to minimise the impact
      to those who wish to remain in the area in normal houses. The problem is how
      do you write this into a policy? and if we got it into policy how do we ensure
      that we get the development we want in the locations we want? \r\n\r\nAt the
      moment it is the market dictating what is to be built..... whereas I think it
      should be our policy. People (with two cars!) are buying these houses with single
      garages... if people just stopped buying then them the developers would get
      the message soon enough. Mind you I have been at odds with the panel a number
      of times regarding the on street and visitor parking allowances. We often round
      down # parks when we should be rounding up.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nNathan\r\n"

    text: "\"What are your specific concerns?\" you cant be serious???\r\n\r\nThis
      over development & increase of population density has got to stop. Does the
      Marion Council honestly think this area has the infrastructure to sustain a
      continuing increase of population? When driving down any side street now you
      have to avoid cars that are constantly parked in the street as residents of
      these developments simply do not have the parking for multiple vehicles &/or
      if there is a garage it is so small they use it for storage not parking a car
      in.\r\n\r\nGet real Marion Council, your development plans will turn our suburbs
      into  overpopulated Ghetto's & it certainly will not be a pleasant place to
      live that's for sure. I have lived in the area for more than 55 years, if this
      is an ongoing example of your future plans for this area I for one am looking
      to move out before you make this suburb & the rest of Marion Council area into
      Adelaides future slums.\r\n\r\nShame shame shame. Please stop the over-development.
      Enough is enough. "

        Dear Ferna,

        We hear you and I live in Warradale. Let me assure you that the Marion Council has made a submission to reduce housing density in the areas that you refer. It is now up to the new State Government to approve Marion Councils proposed Development Plan.

        Agree that the current situation is crap.

        Kind regards

    text: I think what Nathan Prior is alluding to here is that our suburb is very
      short of the longer term basic functionality. What I mean by this is basic needs
      on a daily basis. Try driving down these surrounding streets - they are so over
      crowded with parked cars it has become hazardous. We know that new developments
      are asked to provide for 2 off-street car parks but guess what "hardly any of
      them park off street". It has become so bad that I cannot get safely out of
      my driveway due to heavy industrial vans blocking the basic view up the street
      for oncoming traffic. Needless to say have any family or friends visit us, as
      they cant park anywhere near the house. Our suburb does not need multiple dwellings
      upon existing blocks of land. It does nothing to improve our suburb and only
      detracts from the previous situation where we could all fit to the space available.
      This is part one. Part two is what the builders did to my property with the
      development next door- and guess what "they never paid a cent in repair" simply
      promised the world and never did anything. I visited council on this only to
      be told that there is nothing they can do and I need to speak to the builder.
      Well the builder knows this and that is why they simply promise all repair in
      the world and deliver nothing

      I really do hope this is knocked back for the terrible idea that it is but given

      The council don't seem to mind as long as their coffers are replenished. My
      dealings with them in simply trying to get the developers to adhere to the approved
      plans repeatedly fell on deaf ears or dull minds. So what can you do? Fight

    text: "Councillor Crossland,\r\n\r\nPlease see notes to your fellow two Councillors
      on the recent closed decision from your Council on 73 Cove Road. Below for completeness
      is a copy of my 18th DEC 2017 letter to the Mayor; his response did not address
      the matters raised. \r\n\r\nI am concerned about the integrity of the Council's
      decision making process and belief there is a conflict of interest in the Council
      determining this case, given the likelihood of a substantial claim from Mr Fleetwood
      for given the initial approval in 2011 for 73 Cove Road. I would appreciate
      your position on this matter. \r\nThank you.\r\nBob McGivern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMayor

      copy to:\r\n\r\n1.\tCouncilor Crossland, Marion Council\r\n2.\tCEO Adrian Skull,
      Marion Council\r\n3.\tAdelaide Advertiser\r\n4.\tOmbudsman SA\r\n5.\tState Commission
      Assessment Panel\r\n6.\tDavid Speirs MP for Bright\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mayor Hanna,\r\n\r\nRe:
      73 Cove Road – Council Planning and Legal Compliance\r\nThe purpose of this
      letter is to again request your leadership with respect to Marion Council’s
      planning department and seek their compliance with the Development Act 1993
      (“the Act”) and Development Regulations 2008 (“the Regulations”). \r\nI am grateful
      (and I mean that) for you calling out the improper behaviour of the planning
      department including highlighting their lack of control and the self commissioning
      of legal support without recourse (>$250k direct costs on this case alone, with
      over $490k this last FY, excluding council costs and overheads). \r\nOn a personal
      note, I do not agree with the criticism you have received in the press for this
      case. I wish the press would spend time to better understand how Mr. Fleetwood
      has manipulated and misled the system to arrive at this unfortunate point.  I
      attach in Appendix A, a copy of a letter to the Adelaide Advertiser which went
      unanswered. This information may help your engagement with the press. \r\nI
      now learn that your planning department is supporting yet another planning application
      for 73 Cove Road from Mr. Fleetwood and I have little confidence in the planning
      department acting in compliance with the Act and Regulations. This lack of confidence
      is based on the following facts:\r\n1.\tCompliance with the ERD Judgement: at
      the 6th Sept 2017 Development Assessment Panel your Council recommended approval
      of another planning application (100/408/2017) for 73 Cove Road from Mr. Fleetwood,
      which was at total odds with the previous ERD judgement – fortunately the DAP
      showed some independence and rejected this application 5 to 1, with only the
      Chair  showing support (as he did in the 2015 assessment)\r\n\r\nDespite the
      ERD’s judgement stating the “size and build”  of the property is seriously at
      odds with the Development Plan with the revised plans not addressing the size
      or build, your Council did not reject Mr. Fleetwood’s plan outright and instead
      administered a biased process (see 2 below for substantiation) to assess the
      plan through another DAP process. \r\n\r\nThis Council action is at odds with
      the Act where:\r\n\r\n “A relevant Authority may…. d) refuse an application
      that relates to a development of a kind that is described as a non-complying
      development under the relevant Development Plan without proceeding to make an
      assessment of the application” \r\n\r\nWhilst there are technical arguments
      that the balance of complying and non-complying aspects must be considered as
      a whole, the ERD made it very clear that a “significant departure”  exists,
      in particular: \r\n\r\n“In our view, the proposed design results in a building
      of considerable height and bulk which, when combined with its inadequate setback
      from the rear boundary, will present as a dominant building in terms of its
      visual impact, particularly for the occupants of numbers 12 and 13.”  \r\n\r\nI
      suggest a reasonable third party would have assessed the application as non-compliant
      with the ERD judgement and not convened the DAP process. Moreover, it also appears
      the CEO also has little regard for the authority of planning law where in a
      recent letter he advises:\r\n\r\n“… each Panel has deemed the proposal acceptable.
      We note the court has different opinion, which it entitled to do so.” \r\n\r\nI
      note that precedent exists within your Council in rejecting plans outright without
      convening DAP, or its replacement.  So clearly the Council is aware of this
      legal obligation and I assume the CEO is aware of the Rule of Law. \r\n\r\n2.\tBias
      Planning Team: as part of the Sept 2017 planning application your Council sponsored
      a purportedly independent planner to assess the application and using rate payers’
      money, commissioned Helen Dyer. \r\n\r\nDespite three residents’ outright rejection
      of the Sept 2017 planning application, with only one resident supporting (being
      the sponsor of the planning application, Mr. Fleetwood), the independent planner
      stated there was “general support” for the application. \r\n\r\nI welcome any
      reasonable third party to provide an opinion on why and how this Council commissioned
      report could caste such a conclusion in light of the overwhelming rejection
      from the residents!\r\n\r\nFurther, this report stated the planning application
      was “partially compliant” and “generally compliant” across over 100 separate
      assessment criteria using your Development Plan, when no such compliance attributes
      exist: a matter is either compliant or it is not complaint, as highlighted by
      Charmaine Threadgold from the DAP (see below).\r\n\r\nOnly a minor number of
      criteria were assessed to be compliant with the Development Act in this Council
      commissioned planned report. Fortunately the DAP stated their displeasure with
      this report providing damming criticism in particular by Charmaine Threadgold
      – some quotes from the DAP meeting 6th SEPT 2017:\r\nCharmaine Threadgold\r\n“The
      proposal has a fundamentally flawed starting point”\r\n“I find this application
      unacceptable”\r\n“The visual impact is unacceptable”\r\nCited the Authority
      of the ERD para 121,156,157 and 188 and others\r\nChallenged the planner’s report
      “of the 109 provisions of the DP mentioned in the planners report, the proposal
      satisfied all but 2”. Pointed out that if they only partially or generally complied,
      that did not meet the requirements\r\n\r\nNick Westwood \r\n“It is beyond rescue”
      \r\n“No happy future for it”\r\n\r\nJanet Byram \r\n“The bulk and scale is a
      serious issue” \r\n“I am concerned with the amount of cut & fill without consideration
      for the repercussions”\r\n” I am concerned with the level of amenity”  \r\n\r\nNathan
      Sim \r\n“The amount of fill is a serious concern” \r\n“The visual impact is
      a major problem”\r\n\r\nLuke Hutchinson\r\n“The bulk & scale is unacceptable”
      \r\n“I don’t see amenity of the building for the occupants”  \r\n\r\nNote: A
      set of minutes from the DAP meeting were forwarded to your planning department
      (8th SEPT 2017 to Robert Tokley) from the residents and the accuracy of these
      minutes can be attested by no less than five separate parties. \r\nNote also
      that I requested to record the DAP meeting and despite the obligation of transparency,
      this request was refused.  \r\nIn short, your planning department commissioned
      and supported this bias planner’s report. I urge you to review it please to
      form your own view. See Appendix B for some photographic examples of the impact.\r\n3.\tRobert
      Tokley – Breach of Code of Conduct: The ERD has also ruled that your planning
      department has acted out of convenience for its own cause and singled out the
      actions of your planner Robert Tokley as being unacceptable:\r\n\r\n“It was
      not for Mr. Tokley to consider whether there was, in his opinion, a “practical
      reason” to require a further development application. The question Mr. Tokley
      should have asked himself was what was required in the circumstances by the
      Act, not by his or the Fleetwood’s convenience.” \r\nDespite this legal opinion,
      Robert Tokley operated as the executive officer for the Sept 2017 planning application
      and all previous applications, and commissioned the biased works of Helen Dyer
      and made the Council recommendation to accept the application.\r\nFurther, during
      the run-up to the 6th Sept 2017, Robert Tokley did not release Mr. Fleetwood’s
      response to the residents. \r\nI have studied your Code of Conduct and the requirements
      from the Act and Regulations and suggest this individual has breached the aforementioned
      and ask that he be removed from any part of the process going forward. Given
      these facts, I request you consider again the use SCAP in deciding any action
      on this case. \r\nPer our previous correspondence, I know of four willing planners
      who will provide information in Court detailing inconsistencies when dealing
      with Robert Tokley and his interpretation of the Development Plan. I also note
      your March 2017 report details a commercial organization who submitted a formal
      complaint of inconsistency.\r\nA complaint has been lodged through the Council
      portal on this matter though I have little confidence in this being properly
      addressed, similar to the multiple freedom of information requests previously
      submitted without provision of a satisfactory answer to most, e.g. the Council
      cannot provide these documents as they are stored off-site. \r\nRequest\r\nI
      would appreciate your consideration of the above letter, in particular seeking
      the immediate discontinuation of the vexatious and frivolous applications from
      Mr. Fleetwood and a legally compliant application of the Act and Regulations
      to this case. I suggest there is a public interest factor in play for this case,
      and I ask your Elected Members to consider this also.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely\r\n\r\nBob
      McGivern\r\n \r\nAppendix A – Letter to David Penberthy, Adelaide Advertiser,
      15th Sept 2017\r\nDavid,\r\n I have read your opinion note in the Advertiser
      today and write representing the \"other side\" of the coin from a resident's
      perspective.\r\n I am one of the residents who objected to the planning application
      and to date, the residents have kept quiet. Attached is a series of docs (publicly
      available) which give another view of the planning application from Mr. Fleetwood.
      There is no doubt the Council, in particular Robert Tokley, have a case to answer.
      The magnitude of the problems does not solely lie at their door.\r\nSome facts
      for consideration\r\n DAP approved Mr. Fleetwood's planning application on 21
      DEC 2011 - this approval was given despite a number of non-compliant positions
      of the planning application to the regulations\r\nThe residents were not consulted
      in the process - for example Mr. Thomas at 15a Westcliff engaged all the residents
      when developing his plans. The first sight the residents had for 73 Cove Road
      was a Council planner arriving to assess Mr. Fleetwood's application, shortly
      followed by construction vehicle arriving on scene\r\nMr. Fleetwood constructed
      his application to categorise it in a way that removed the requirement for him
      to consult neighbours - that was a clear decision from Mr. Fleetwood\r\nShortly
      after the 2011 Council approval, the decision was overturned in Court by the
      Paiors. The house was partially built at this stage\r\nNow - instead of stopping
      his build, Mr. Fleetwood accelerated his house build and submitted another planning
      application to revise his retaining walls - he was in direct breach of the law
      by continuing the build\r\nThe retain walls application was approved - this
      was NOT the approval of the partially-built house but of the land - nonetheless
      Mt Fleetwood claims incorrectly this was approval for the property - a misrepresentation
      to the public and a failure by the Council to prevent his continued illegal
      build\r\nFurther, from the 2011 approval, Mr. Fleetwood built in direct contravention
      to his (later to be illegal) approval. He injected hundreds of tonnes of fill
      to the land, artificially raising the ground. This is a breach of the planning
      regulations. Photographs are evidenced in the documents attached\r\nDuring the
      2012 court case, the Judge stated that Robert Tokley and Mr. Fleetwood should
      not act out of their own convenience but out of respect for the law - I have
      a letter from the Council CEO (Adrian Skull) suggesting contempt for the Court's
      authority\r\nSo now both Tokley and Mr. Fleetwood realise their errors and continue
      to pool together to continue the path and consume over $300k of ratepayers money
      defending their decision in court against the Paiors\r\nThen we arrive at present
      day and Tokley commissions an \"independent report\" for the July 2017 planning
      application. Attached. Despite three neighbours rejecting to the application
      and one neighbour supporting [Mr. Fleetwood's family] the report states \"general
      support for the application\" from the Council to the DAP - again this is Mr.
      Tokley seeking to act out of convenience for his previous error\r\nFortunately
      the members of the DAP have paid attention to the Court's authority and rejected
      Mr. Fleetwood's application - the approval from the Chair was more to save face,
      given he approved the 2015 revised application, that was also again later overturned
      in Court. \r\n So as you can see from these facts [all publicly available] that
      the problems lie very squarely at Mr. Fleetwood's door also. The Council is
      culpable (Mr. Tokley) for approving the 2011 application and for continuing
      to spend rate payer’s money defending their decision against the Paiors, whilst
      Mr. Fleetwood stands on the side. \r\n The fortunate factor is the Mayor. He
      is the one who forced the CEO to require Mr. Tokley to seek approval for continued
      spend on legal resources and the one, who as far as I can see, has sought to
      ensure the planning department acts with integrity. He has sought a review of
      the planning processes. \r\n It may help your opinion to also investigate the
      wider history of Mr. Fleetwood. That may result in a more balanced view of this
      unfortunate story and help illustrate his behaviour over this case.\r\n I suggest
      the Council has a very strong case to refute any claims from Mr. Fleetwood.
      He continued to build when the approval was overturned, but more important,
      he built in direct contravention of the approval, that later overturned. \r\n
      All of this may not have happened if Mr. Fleetwood had consulted his neighbours.
      \r\n Hopefully this information helps you provide the other side of the coin
      from one of the residents who have an illegal property directly overlooking
      his property with views straight into my bedroom. That is a breach of statutory
      law. I am happy to take questions if you deem necessary.\r\nBob McGivern\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAppendix

        Dear Bob
        Thanks for your email.
        I have not been involved in the approval of this application so I cannot provide you with any further information in this regard. Our CAP (Council Assessment Panel) make decisions on around 10% of applications. Therefore, you will need to contact our planning staff to assist with further information, I have included Jason the Manager of Planning Services.

        Ps: I have been listed as a proxy on the CAP in the last year, hence why you may have contacted me.

        Best regards, Luke.

        Dear Mr Missen,

        Thank you for your correspondence 7 June 2018 via Planning Alerts regarding the current development application concerning proposed enhancements at 36 Lakefield Drive, North Lakes.

        I have referred your comments onto the Department of Development Services who are responsible for the assessment of the application. I have specifically asked the team to consider the interface of the proposed path with the existing units at 50 Lakefield Drive. I understand the team are considering some potential amendments to the plans including increase buffer and planting. These proposed amendments will be discussed with the applicant.

        I have asked the team to liaise with you directly post their discussions with the applicant.

        If there is anything further you require please let me know.

      does not not adequately consider the local residents at 50 Lakefield Drive whose
      premises abut the park . It should be possible to consider:\r\n1. A buffer zone
      along the western edge of the park to minimise visual and acoustic interference
      to the residents of 50 Lakefield Drive.\r\n2. Paths that follow the route people
      naturally walk. People don't naturally choose a zig-zag route. \r\nThank you."

      Surely given the expanse of park available it is not the councils intention

      it not have been possible to move this more toward the centre of the park and

    text: "Can I draw attention to a dubious planning approval right at the end of
      Mayfield St! Not far from this proposed development. \r\nHow can a large popular
      business area with on site parking be approved without turn in access to traffic
      if they come from the wrong direction?? The no right turn and narrow parking
      opposite the Buderim village park shops has created a dangerous intersection
      where shoppers choose to do an illegal U turn  in Mayfield St (in front of no
      U-turn sign or in someone’s driveway) in order to gain access the shops. \r\nTo
      add to this, these vehicles combine with other vehicles during peak periods
      using Mayfield as a shortcut to avoid the traffic lights at the end of Gloucester
      rd.. \r\nTo add to this also, Mayfield has effectively become a one way street
      as staff have chosen to use it as their car park for the day. \r\nThis combines
      to be an inevitable accident waiting to happen!! \r\nThe business precinct at
      the end of Mayfield St is evidence of shoddy planning practices that councillors
      have chosen to turn a blind eye too!!\r\n\r\nBuderim cannot cope with any more
      medium density living period! \r\n\r\nI live at the end of Mayfield and police
      are being sent video evidence of these offences.. Councillors included!"

    text: "Having been ignored by planning in relation to my previous objections to
      this development, I do not hold great expectations of a response this time.\r\nHowever,
      I must reiterate my concern that the number of units on this site will not only
      negatively impact on the street scape and heritage overlay of the area but will
      cause major congestion of car traffic in Temperance Hall Lane.\r\nThis has already
      begun with the developer/contractor  encroaching on the lane way and the lane
      way being blocked for long periods denying access to and from my property. Once
      completed the lane way which currently has car and pedestrian access will become
      significantly congested and potentially dangerous.\r\nThis current amendment
      does not seem to alter my concerns, but I suspect, as always any amendment will
      favourite the developer."

    text: I was quite digusted with the development in Albert St; learned of Planning
      Alerts and subscribed; hence why I now peruse local developments. I originally
      wanted to just view the documents listed for 29 Joseph St on MBRC PD Online
      but for whatever reasons I have encountered issues opening the documents posted.
      I am yet to ascertain if it is an issue on my particular laptop, or whether
      it is a council issue. I believe in development and the comments posted by Jessica
      above. However, squeezing in excessive amounts of units on small blocks and
      blocks with narrow road frontage is not the solution. Most of the units will
      be 2 bedroom and have 2 car parks allocated on the site. But it's the eg third
      occupant and potential third car of the 2 bedroom unit if there is a couple
      and and a grown up child that occupy the 2 bedroom unit. we all know children
      are staying at home until in their thirties. Then there's the visitors cars.
      I know of developments with 10-15 units and yes there might be a 20m road frontage
      to put the wheelie bins, but they put all the bins out early the day before,
      and place them not on the footpath, but in the actual gutter. This is not only
      a breach of Local Laws but also denies drivers who pay registration the opportunity
      to park on the street. And the MBRC Ranger enforcing Local Laws turns a blind
      eye. Redcliffe did not have all these issues before amalgamation. I am also
      making a point of notifying different councillors each time I post. They all
      need to read such comments posted by the people, bang their heads together and
      begin standing up for the people collectively. I think the Planning Alerts comment
      that Don’t worry if you don’t know who to contact. Every councillor is there
      to represent you so just pick someone who seems nice. I have had first hand
      experience where I once contacted a councillor outside of my zone and they didn't
      want to know about it. The reason I contacted a councillor outside of the zone
      was because the councillor for the zone did not appear to want to become engaged.
      So much for representation and a local mouthpiece

    text: 'At least the size of the block is >800sqm. I was living in Albert St and
      the developer somehow managed to squeeze 6 units on a block across the road
      at 4 Albert St which is <700sqm! To compound issues, not only did the size of
      the block not qualify for such a development, the road frontage was 15 metres
      wide; when 20sqm was the default required size. Then the developer who eventually
      developed the approved units encroached closer to the adjoining boundary than
      the approved DA requirement without relaxation. The Site Cover (footprint) of
      the development increased without relaxation. This also resulted in less recreational
      and landscape area to create buffers from the neighbour. I pity the adjoining
      neighbours, as there is no way the Acoustic Reports required could be compliant;
      as the Acoustic Report was compiled prior to the DA being approved; and then
      the developer encroached closer after the DA was approved, without further Acoustic
      tests being performed to factor a reduced side boundary. With 6 units having
      to share 6 wheelie bins in total; when all bins are out (for  general, and recycle
      week) they take up all the footpath (add the double driveway). And the original
      developer who had the DA approved is on the record for ''swapping'' houses with
      the mayor? The second developer who eventually bought the DA approved block
      also removed the adjoining 1.8m boundary fences without the required paperwork
      to the neighbours, and did not consult with the neighbour. A new combination
      retainer-fence was erected and exceeds 2.5-2.7m in places on the neighbours
      side, and no relaxation to exceed a combined 2.0m was approved by MBRC. This
      is the dark side of developments that councillors and the planning authority
      need to address. The development did not exceed the required height to trigger
      Impact assessment; and was approved under a Code Assessment. Code Assessments
      do not require signs to be placed outside the front of the property to advise
      the public of the proposed development. Neighbours, and the general public are
      kept in the dark. Planningalerts.com.au has to be commended for making such
      developments public knowledge. I am sure there would be potential compliance
      problems when it comes to Fire Safety Compliance. After watching the Grenfell
      Towers in London debacle, I have concerns about the private certifiers who certify
      such developments. Gone are the days of Council Building Inspectors. Developers
      now pay the Private Certifiers. '

    text: "Hello Jane,\r\nIn your response to Celine F you state: \"I understand that
      the driver and need for this project has arisen from community consultation
      regarding the Surrey Hills Village, and is accepted by Council as a legitimate
      need to be addressed\"\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons I do not believe the
      justification for an automated public toilet in Surrey Hills Village has been
      demonstrated by Council: \r\n\r\n1. I understand Boroondara Council is yet to
      complete its Public Toilet Strategy (PTS). \r\n\r\n2. Given the significant
      capital ($209K) and ongoing cleaning and maintenance costs \r\nassociated with
      an automated public toilet, it’s reasonable to expect a PTS would require a
      NEEDS-BASED assessment to determine if one is required in a locality. \r\n\r\n3.
      A needs-based assessment is: \r\na. Objective - its considered parameters are
      clearly understood and underpin the PTS \r\nb. Measurable - quantifiable (e.g.
      existing number of toilets, distances, visitors, events) \r\nc. Independent
      - removes any conflict of interest \r\nd. Transparent - decision making process
      is clear to all stakeholders \r\ne. Fiscally responsible - ensures accountability
      for public expenditures \r\nf. Fair to all stakeholders - outcome is more able
      to be accepted, fosters harmony \r\ng. Essential for good governance - creates
      confidence in Council’s decision making processes \r\n\r\n4. To my knowledge,
      a needs-based assessment has not been undertaken for another public toilet in
      Surrey Hills Village. \r\n\r\n5. Community responses to an outdated 2010 draft
      Shopping Centre Improvement Plan for Surrey Hills Village and a general statement
      (by yourself) that Council aims to provide a public toilet in all medium/large
      shopping centres has been given as justification: \r\na. This fails good governance
      and understates the importance for stakeholders. \r\nb. Surrey Hills Village
      is a small shopping centre. \r\nc. Cafes & restaurants which provide their own
      toilets are the predominant business activity. \r\nd. A \"cookie cutter\" approach
      devalues the unique & distinguishing characteristics of Surrey Hills Village.\r\n\r\n6.
      Visitors to Surrey Hills Village already have access to multiple public toilets:
      \r\na. Surrey Hills Neighbourhood Centre (open weekdays) \r\nb. Surrey Hills
      Train Station (open 4:50am – midnight Sun-Thurs, open 24 hours on Fri & Sat)
      \r\nc. Local cafes and restaurants (open until late) \r\nd. There are at least
      12 businesses which provide toilet facilities for their customers. \r\n\r\n7.
      With few exceptions, most businesses north of the railway line provide toilet
      facilities for patrons during their hours of operation. \r\n\r\n8. There are
      3 take-away food outlets south of the railway line. In the evening, any demand
      for toilet facilities from patrons of these TAKE-AWAY food outlets can be met
      by using toilets at the Surrey Hills train station.\r\n\r\nIt is fiscally irresponsible
      for Boroondara Council to proceed in the absence of a needs-based assessment.\r\n"

    text: "Dear Jane\r\n\r\nIn the interest of transparency, I note that we had our
      conversation on Monday 14 May 2018.\r\n\r\nI confirm that you are not aware
      of a Boroondara public toilet strategy at present. In light of this, I canvass
      my concerns again about Boroondara Council not having objective standards or
      proper guidance as to the need or location of a toilet. \r\n\r\nI mentioned
      my disappointment with not having a proper process including a public consultation
      for necessity and/or location for the toilet,  and you intimated that this may
      be the start of process for a public consultation.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am heartened
      by that, you can understand my surprise as there is already a line item in the
      proposed Council budget for 2018/ 2019 of $209,000 for a public toilet in Surrey
      Hills Shopping Centre.  Nevertheless, I will take your word for it that we are
      at the start of a process of proper consultation which will hopefully include
      more than one location for a proposed public toilet.  I also referred you to
      the Ormond Road public toilet consultation which had almost 8 different proposed
      sites and the recent one in Alchester Village, Boronia  which had 3 different
      sites.\r\n\r\nWe then had a discussion about locating the toilet at Surrey Gardens.
      \ I stated that Surrey Gardens being 1000m away from the next nearest public
      toilet at Hamilton Street, Mont Albert, was ideally situated as it maximized
      the catchment area for a toilet whilst still allowing both Surrey Gardens  users
      and Surrey Hills shopping centre precinct users access to another public toilet.
      \ \r\n\r\nAs you can appreciate, there are no public toilets on the south side
      of Canterbury Road,  between Warrigal Road and Highfield St, whereas the north
      side of Canterbury Road (where Croydon Road is located) is already serviced
      by 2 public toilets (Hamilton Street, Mont Albert - 700m away) and Surrey Hills
      Neighbourhood House (Union Road itself). There is also the Surrey Hills Station
      toilets.   By locating the toilet in Surrey Gardens Council is ensuring that
      the south side of Canterbury Road users also has access to a public toilet whilst
      not depriving the shopping centre users on the north side of Canterbury Road
      of another public toilet if necessary.\r\n\r\nI also pointed out that placing
      the toilet in Surrey Gardens would also allow Council to achieve its stated
      goals under Parks and Green Spaces, specifically strategy 2.5 in the Community
      Plan 2017 to 2027 which states that it is Council objective to increase and
      improve public amenities and facilities in open spaces to enhance functionality
      for a wider range of uses. \r\n\r\nYou stated, without even further consultation,
      \ that this was too far. I am somewhat surprised at this subjective statement,
      as I pointed out that a public toilet survey in Moreland has indicated that
      \ people are happy to walk between 2 to 5 minutes to locate a public toilet
      (100m to 400m) .  A similar survey was recently  (2017) carried out at Banyule
      with a similar outcome.  Surrey Gardens is 100m away from the start of the shopping
      precinct and NO FURTHER than 400m away to the END of the shopping precinct.
      \   \r\n \r\nWe did not discuss Bryson Street toilets nor Naturestrip guidelines.
      \r\n\r\nFinally, I emphasized the need for a genuine public consultation based
      on a current public toilet strategy for Boroondara, assuming that a toilet is
      firstly necessary.  A public consultation that canvasses options for the community
      to consider, with complete transparency about the various safety and amenity
      implications of each location in order for the community to make an informed
      decision \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        Hello Celine
        I think the only point you raise that has not already been answered relates to the question of whether there is a demonstrated need/desire for a public toilet.

        I understand that the driver and need for this project has arisen from community consultation regarding the Surrey Hills Village, and is accepted by Council as a legitimate need to be addressed.

        Council will continue to work with the community and stakeholders in seeking to find an appropriate location for the facility that best aligns with the range of views on this matter.

    text: "Dear Jane\r\n\r\nThank you for your response above which unfortunately
      has raised even more concerns :\r\n\r\n1. No public consultation - We note that
      there has been not been any meetings with traders  (or residents for that matter)
      except for one with SHNC (which is Council owned and operated) and a SHPA representative.
      \ As no public consultation has yet to be held regarding this toilet,  be it
      in relation to the location or necessity, it would be good governance in terms
      of transparency of the process that a public consultation is held in accordance
      with Council's Civil Leadership and Governance Objective.  It is critical in
      our view that a public consultation for a toilet should be one that canvasses
      a number of options for the location of a public toilet to allow the community
      to decide - examples include the one that was held in Ormond Road.  \r\n\r\n2.
      No public toilet strategy - We understand that Boroondara is in the midst of
      finalising a public toilet strategy. Without a current public toilet strategy
      and without public consultation as to the necessity or location of a toilet,
      this makes the process subjective and possibly not as transparent as it should
      or could be, though I appreciate your responses here in this public platform.
      \ \r\n\r\n3. An outdated petition - We understand that Council is being guided
      by the need for a public toilet based on a petition in 2012. A petition is NOT
      proper public consultation requiring input from internal and external stakeholders.
      A petition may not have sufficient detail to determine locality of toilet. A
      petition in 2012, is 6 years old. It is not good governance to rely on a petition
      in 2012 to determine this critical issue within a community.\r\n\r\n4. The problem
      with Bryson Street toilets: - I would like to point out some significant dissimilarities
      between Bryson Street and Croydon Road as you have often used this example as
      a precedent.\r\n\r\n4.1 Location - Bryson Street toilets are not the nature
      strip of a residential road. In fact, Bryson street's public toilet is located
      IN a Council owned PUBLIC CARPARK on the side facing Bryson Street, which has
      OPEN SPACE surrounding it and all sides of the toilet are clearly visible. Croydon
      Road's proposed toilet is ON a NATURE STRIP of a residential road approximately
      15m recessed from the main pedestrian street of Union Road, flanked by mature
      trees and tall buildings. \r\n\r\n4.2 Compliance with CPTED - Overall, between
      the two toilets, the Bryson Street toilet, complies better with CPTED (Crime
      Prevention through Environmental Design) standards although it still lacks the
      visibility that would fully comply with CPTED standards as seen in the Boroondara
      Maling Road Built form design guidelines updated by Council in June 2015 which
      states that natural surveillance of the Council carparks (which include Bryson
      Street) is poor and could be significantly improved. This highlights that Council
      is acknowledging that natural surveillance is poor on Bryson Street carpark
      and toilets and SIGNIFICANT improvement has to be carried out, and confirms
      our submission that toilets and sensitive places in locations where there is
      a lack of natural surveillance does not conform with Council's policies and
      design guidelines.   Accordingly, perhaps both Bryson Street and Croydon Road
      should NOT have been in locations where toilets should be installed.  Clearly,
      two wrongs do not make a right.\r\n\r\nTo take the comparison further, unlike
      Bryson Street toilets, Croydon road's proposed toilet location is that it is
      to be placed on a NATURE STRIP of a heritage overlay residential road, about
      15 metres recessed from the main pedestrian strip of Union road. There is a
      NARROW footpath between the toilet and the building next to the toilet, and
      there are mature trees and tall structures surrounding the toilet. Croydon Road's
      toilet location is worse than the one on Bryson Street which at least is IN
      a carpark area and part of the MALING ROAD shopping precinct (as the Maling
      Road shopping precinct does include parts of Bryson Street as seen in the design
      plans of the Maling Road Design guidelines 2015 )  whereas Croydon Road is NOT
      part of a shopping precinct, and given that Bryson Street's toilet car park
      area is ALREADY being identified as needing SIGNIFICANT improvement by Council
      themselves,  to encourage natural surveillance, we would submit that Croydon
      Road's toilet location is therefore certain not to be likely to satisfy CPTED
      standards of visibility, location and access, in that it is recessed into Croydon
      Road, it has very little open space between the toilet and the building next
      to it,  and there are tall buildings and mature trees in the vicinity, and it
      is not visible from Union Road and its foot traffic. \r\n\r\nI also note that
      naturestrips in Boroondara Natureships Guidelines Policy December 2015, one
      critical objective of naturestrips are that they are meant to improve public
      safety by enabling clear ‘line of sight’ between pedestrians, vehicle drivers
      and cyclists at driveways, road curves and intersection.  It goes against the
      very purpose of natureships in Council's own policy installing on a toilet on
      a nature strip,  especially given that sight line issues have already been raised
      for that very corner as part of the Coles development occurring from traffic
      safety engineers. \r\n\r\n5. Alternative locations: -Whilst I note your comment
      regarding placement of the toilet at the back of SHNC not complying with CPTED
      standards, I think a suitable spot for the toilet would be in the front courtyard
      of the SHNC.  Whilst we accept that this would take away some open space, the
      benefit of having a location for the toilet which complies fully with CPTED
      standards for safety is very compelling for a community.  \r\n\r\nThe SHNC is
      also situated in front of a pedestrian crossing and is surrounded by restaurants
      that are opened till late, thus allowing a natural surveillance of the area
      as recommended by CPTED. The proposed site for Croydon Road toilets being slightly
      recessed from Union Road, and blocked by a tree, is not as visible as SHNC.
      \ When comparing Union Road and Croydon Road, there is much less foot traffic
      for obvious reasons in Croydon being a residential road as opposed to the main
      pedestrian shopping strip.\r\n\r\nWe also understand that Council has had issues
      attempting to use the Surrey Hills station carpark land as it is Victrack land.
      \ I recommend greater efforts be used here as most in the Surrey Hills community
      is in support of the the use of this land for a public toilet. \r\n\r\n6. Medium
      sized shopping centres - I also note that you said Council aims that medium
      sized to large sized shopping centres would have a toilet. Could you please
      direct me to the policy regarding this? But as an aside, I note that the Property
      Council of Australia defines medium sized shopping centres to be typically incorporating
      at least ONE FULL LINE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE, a major supermarket and around
      40 or more specialty shops.  - Surrey Hills shopping village does not satisfy
      this definition.  Can you please clarify this?\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I recommend
      that Council :\r\n\r\n1. complete their public toilet strategy; and\r\n2. apply
      the strategy and carry out a proper consultative process.\r\n\r\nThis allows
      the best form of governance and transparency, which we submit is the cornerstone
      of Boroondara's Council strategic objectives for 2017 to 2027.\r\n\r\n If a
      toilet was still deemed necessary after Council has applied the public toilet
      strategy, Council should carry out a proper public consultation canvassing the
      different locations possible at Surrey Hills, carrying out a CPTED safety audit
      on various sites proposed.  This gives the internal and external stakeholders
      a proper ownership of the location of the toilet which in itself is a recommendation
      of public toilet strategies in other Councils as it is believed to result in
      a better and safer outcome for the toilets.\r\n\r\nThank you for continuing
      to address this as best you can in a public platform. It is important that stakeholders
      are aware of this process in a transparent and open manner, which allows proper
      ownership of the decisions made by Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    text: "Dear Jane\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response. I am heartened to
      hear that you are still seeking public opinion on this issue, and that this
      is not a foregone conclusion as a number of us felt at the public consultations
      for the streetscape (not necessarily the toilet) last Saturday - I understand
      that the traders on Union Road have had a couple of consultations with Council.
      We, the residents, also look forward to having similar discourse with you. Please
      notify us of a suitable time and date, preferably with at least one week's notice.\r\n\r\nI
      seek to clarify my comment above regarding allowing self cleaning toilets in
      residential streets - as you are probably able to discern that this was an inadvertent
      error, but in case not, I will clarify that if Council were to allow a toilet
      in a residential street, then this could result in a foodgates of public toilets
      on residential streets in many parts of Boroondara, as suburbs like Hawthorn,
      Camberwell junction, Hawthorn East have commercial precincts much larger than
      Surrey Hills.  I would urge the residents of  all these suburbs to have careful
      consideration of how the toilets are placed in this scenario as the impact would
      be larger than just for Surrey Hills.  I would be very surprised if there are
      many residents on any street in Boroondara that would be receptive of a public
      toilet on their street.  In short, there should never be public toilets on residential
      streets in Boroondara, and Council should know this, without the need for public
      consultation, especially in our instance where there are Surrey Hill station
      toilets.\r\n\r\nI also submit that if a toilet were necessary,  the toilet should
      be located at the back of the neighbourhood house, which is a Council operated
      and owned land.  The neighbourhood house is in a central position and can be
      accessed by Union Road and Bedford Street.  Concerns about being able to locate
      the public toilet at the back of this property is easily fixed with proper signage
      on Union Road and Bedford Street. I further submit that it by having a public
      toilet accesible during the weekends, and after hours on site, shows compliance
      with the neighbourhood house's standards required by Department of Human Services
      as part of their funding to neighbourhood houses.  At present, there is no public
      toilet available after hours or during the weekends (unless there is a function).
      This does not cater towards people using the courtyard after hours and it would
      be much more inclusive if there was a toilet available to be used on site at
      all times. I wish to also highlight that (1) there is a public toilet just outside
      of the newly renovated Balwyn library and next to McDonalds. Like to like purpose,
      a public toilet should be placed near a community oriented area. Neighbourhood
      Centre is therefore a better choice of location. (2) The Sunday market held
      at St Andrew's Church (Across from Zimt), Music Festival and occasional twilight
      markets are the events that the public toilets will be in great need. Hence
      placing the public toilet outside of the Neighbourhood Centre is the ideal location.\r\n\r\nI
      understood from your comments at the public consultation on Saturday that some
      retailers were keen to have a public toilet in spite of the one in Surrey Hills
      station.  We are a very close knit community at Surrey Hills, and the local
      community are the main supporters of our retail village.  We recommend that
      a public consultation with residents be held with the retailers to discuss the
      issue of the toilet in consultation with Council.  Perhaps they may agree that
      they may better served with a toilet in the neighbourhood house, if at all.\r\n"

        Hello Celine

        Here are some answers to your questions and comments.

        As far as I know there have not been any meetings with traders, certainly not that I have attended. The only meeting I attended was held at Surrey Hills Neighbourhood Centre and largely involved those from SHNC and I think one person from the SH Progress Association.

        At this stage Council wants to wait until after the consultation period, and when we have a better idea of community sentiment before arranging any further discussions.

        Over time, Council aims to make a public toilet available in all medium sized/large shopping centres, and typically this is accommodated within the commercial area. When a toilet was installed within the Maling Road shopping centre the only site that was available was within the commercial section of a side street (Bryson Street) that contained residences beyond the commercial section of the street. This is very similar to the site being considered at Union Road, although I understand that the Croydon Road site is closer to Union Road than the Bryson Street site is to Maling Road.

        One of the considerations when choosing a site for a public toilet is that it should be within an area where people will be regularly walking by. This is for safety reasons. The more secluded parking area behind the SHNC is not considered ideal for this reason.

        The requests that I am aware of for a public toilet have been more from residents than from retailers.

        In conclusion, Council has not made a decision about the site for the toilet and further consideration will not be undertaken until the consultation period is over.

        Regards

    text: "The proposal to locate a self cleaning public toilet on the nature strip
      in Croydon road is generating much angst for local residents who are deeply
      concerned this is even being considered by Boroondara Council. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
      I wasn't able to attend the public consultation yesterday where it was (apparently)
      mentioned that 48 traders & residents have petitioned Boroondara Council for
      a public toilet in Surrey Hills Village. What could possibly be their justification
      when we already have public toilets at the train station, neighbourhood centre
      and those provided by local cafes & restaurants? I understand \"operating hours\"
      for the proposed public toilet are still being determined. This makes even less
      sense.\r\n\r\nI'm opposed to another public toilet in Surrey Hills Village and
      was glad when it didn't form part of the final plan for the COLES development.
      I've also been highly cynical of the official reason for the removal of the
      mature oak tree in Croydon road - it's just been too convenient for the adjacent
      COLES development. But never did I imagine these two issues would become connected.\r\n\r\nI'm
      interested to know whether Croydon road would've been considered the most suitable
      location for a public toilet if the oak tree was still standing? COLES were
      required to retain and build around the heritage art deco wall yet it's apparently
      okay to put a public toilet in front of it? An architecturally designed public
      toilet - however sympathetic to its setting - won't disguise the fact it's a
      toilet as it would defeat its purpose to do so. Have those responsible for this
      proposal sought to views of those responsible for preserving Boroondara's heritage?
      \r\n\r\nAt the VCAT hearing which approved the COLES supermarket, there was
      considerable attention given to the impact on pedestrian & vehicular safety
      from blocking sight lines in the vicinity of the COLES car park exit. Concerned
      residents funded an independent traffic report which identified this issue.
      Boroondara Council say they'll now consider shifting the public toilet closer
      to the intersection with Union road to mitigate against its risk to public safety.
      Do you think this is good enough for what will become a much busier intersection
      when COLES is operational? A public toilet at this location is discretionary
      and there's no need to compromise public safety. And what will be the impact
      on the mature tree on this corner - will it too suffer the same fate as its
      neighbouring mature pin oak tree, for \"safety\" reasons?\r\n\r\nSince Boroondara
      Council are effectively sanctioning public toilets in residential streets with
      this proposal - something I am vehemently opposed to - why was Guildford road
      dismissed as the preferred option? It's nature strip is just as wide and there's
      no heritage art deco wall to contend with at this location? \r\n\r\nI'm unaware
      of any self cleaning public toilet in Boroondara that's located on the nature
      strip of a residential street. They are located either within or adjacent to
      a car park. If another public toilet is deemed necessary, what's preventing
      it being located in either the station car park or the council-owned car park
      behind the neighbourhood centre? Is it beyond the wit of Boroondara Council
      to negotiate with VicTrack? Alternatively, rather than reducing the usable space
      in the neighbourhood centre courtyard with more planting, why not set aside
      some of this space for an architecturally designed public toilet?\r\n\r\nFor
      a mature oak tree in a residential street to be been felled and Boroondara Council
      propose it be replaced with a public toilet is a disgrace. Why shouldn't I conclude
      that residents are being stitched up at the behest of vested interests?\r\n\r\nI
      urge Boroondara Council to abandon this proposal."

    text: "Dear Jane\r\nIt has come to our attention that there will be a self cleaning
      toilet placed on Croydon Road Surrey Hills, in the location where an established
      tree was recently removed which you claim in your comment above 5 months ago
      was due to decay as stated by the Council arborist, which I note coincidentally
      and conveniently allows Coles greater access to its work site. Fortunately,
      for our community, it does not appear that any other tree other than the tree
      presumably obstructing access has been deemed in need of removal, of which we
      are thankful.\r\n\r\nThat said, in spite of your assurance above, that a tree
      will be replanted to replace the tree removed and I quote from your comment
      'A new tree is scheduled to be planted and this will occur during winter in
      the 2018 planting season' it appears now that Council is replacing the tree
      with a self cleaning public toilet.  This is dissapointing on many fronts, including
      the necessity of having a public toilet in what is still, a quiet residential
      street. \r\n\r\nBoroondara City Council has been known to be a Council that
      is strict on preserving the culture and landscape of its residential streets.
      It remains a Council that is well served by voters who take pride in the heritage
      of their streetscapes and homes and this is evidenced by the heritage overlays
      in many of the Council's electorates. I urge you not to allow self cleaning
      public toilets on residential streets irrespective of whether regulatory or
      planning laws allow this to occur, it opens up a flood gates for other developers
      to do so, throughout Boroondara. For obvious reasons, this will not be acceptable
      to most. \r\n\r\nIt would also be useful if you could provide us with a copy
      of the Arborist report regarding the decay in the tree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        Hello Celine

        In response to the points you raise:

        Council has not yet made a decision. We are at the stage of seeking feedback through community consultation. After this is completed resident's and trader's responses will be carefully considered.

        The intention continues to be that a replacement tree will be planted at the appropriate time in the vicinity of the tree that required removal.

        I am unsure what you mean when you write: "I urge you not to allow self cleaning public toilets on residential streets irrespective of whether regulatory or planning laws allow this to occur, it opens up a flood gates for other developers to do so, throughout Boroondara." I cannot imagine that developers would seek to build public toilets on residential streets.

        Hello Cam
        I understand that no rules were broken because the façade was assessed by a Structural Engineer as being unsafe.  It is unfortunate that the solution was deemed to be demolition, but the public had to be protected.

        I do not believe that the applicant can be seen as being advantaged by this outcome given that they are required to re-build the façade.

        Hello Rena

        I understand your frustration.

        The wall was required to be removed because it was found to be structurally unstable.

        Council did endeavour to get the best outcome at VCAT it could with this development. You may recall that we did not support the original proposal. Please note that matters such as structural stability are not able to be taken into account at the planning application stage.

Please note that the developer will be required and has agreed to reconstruct the wall using as many salvaged bricks as possible, under the supervision of an architectural heritage consultant.

        The street tree was assessed by Council's arborist as being affected by decay and having a poor structure that was not able to be corrected by pruning and was therefore removed by Council's contractors. A new tree is scheduled to be planted and this will occur during winter in the 2018 planting season.

        Hello Rita,

        I can confirm that the supermarket does not include a public toilet.

        Planning alerts posts all applications as soon as they are registered. Council only displays documents and plans on its website once a decision is made to give public notice. This is because original plans will sometimes be missing information or will change between the time of lodgement and when a decision is made to give notice. If a decision is made not to give notice or an application is exempt from notice according to the planning scheme, plans and documents will not be displayed on the website.

        From the information provided it appears the application involves amending the approved plans in respect to location of utility services, lift overruns and car park exhaust. Officers have not carried out any assessment of the plans as yet. If the changes are significant enough to warrant public notice, then the plans will be displayed on the website once that decision is made.

        Regards
        Jane Addis

    text: "I note the 'plan' attached to this application.\r\nThis is a 'red line'
      plan of relevance to the VCGLR. Council should have no role to play in the granting
      of liquor licenses. \r\nThe said 'plan' is sub-standard, being a hand drawn
      sketch.\r\nIt would seem that there has been no application for the use of this
      building for the preparation and service of food, noting that this building
      has never been used for this purpose and that roof drainage systems in the form
      of open gutters pass through the area within the building shown on this sub-standard
      'red line' plan. \r\nThis can't be a serious proposal and will raise serious
      questions should Council permit the use of this building for food service use.
      \r\nThis proposal as per the plan is not workable as a licensed premises in
      that there will be no practical means of preventing the consumption and serving
      of alcohol outside the 'red line' areas within the building. The whole area
      within building is more realistic as to what practices will occur.\r\nFurthermore,
      it has come to my attention that other Licensed premises serve and allow alcohol
      consumption in the public realm in 'outdoor dining areas' located on footpaths
      fronting the subject premises, and that; a) Council has willingly facilitated
      this practice by permitting the use of footpaths by Licensed premises for tables
      and seating, b) That alcohol and  food consumption and smoking in these said
      areas occurs, c) these areas are outside those defined in the approved 'red
      line' plans, and d)  it is obvious this practice occurs to all and sundry that
      pass, yet Council nor VCGLR nor the Licensee/Approved Managers or Staff do anything
      to enforce this behavior that constitutes STREET DRINKING.    It's about time
      The Bell Tavern and Souki Bar at Belgrave were held to account for the behavior
      associated with their patrons and that serious questions are asked about a Council
      that aides and abets by the granting of use of the public realm by any Licensed
      premises. \r\nI find it hard to believe Council officers who frequent this area
      in Belgrave have not noticed the drinking glasses littering the street in the
      general vicinity of these premises.\r\n \r\nAccordingly, it is reasonable to
      assume a further application will be made to seek tables and chairs on the footpath
      outside this application address and that street drinking will occur outside
      the 'red line' area approved by the VCGLR.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of a Council
      who has an unhealthy bias towards Commercial business activity.\r\n\r\nAs I
      have little confidence in Council to act in accordance to a number of Act's
      they have a statutory obligation to uphold and enforce, the only merit in submitting
      this statement is for users of this site to understand the state of affairs
      in Yarra Ranges Shire Council areas.     "

        Thanks Daniel

        Traffic calming measures on street will need to be considered separately to the planning application, but it's absolutely something we can look into.

        I'll seek some advice from officers about Rosslyn St. Can you email me your direct contact so that I can get back to you on this? The planning-alerts website is difficult to track correspondence through.

        Thanks,

      - which I note has been moonscaped leaving none of the established trees.  From
      Chippewa Avenue to Lisbeth Avenue - a relatively short area of 12 lots - around
      half of the street have large multi-developments stretching down the hill -
      which are seen terracing from Chippewa Avenue.  Note that another property 4
      doors down from this property has removed all the large established trees from
      the property.  This was once termed a leafy suburb.  Now with the multi-developments
      constructed in Chippewa Ave, Cherry Tree Gve, Lisbeth Ave and Wooddale Grove
      - it is simply a sea of houses with no space for trees and within the last ten
      years over 100 trees I would estimate over 80 trees have been removed.  There
      are two large trees of over 100 years still remaining in Chippewa between Niagara
      and Wooddale Gve on the south which can be cut down at any time without a permit.
      \ At 26 Chippewa, a 100 year old Eucalyptus was removed in a dangerous manner
      by unlicensed contractors.  None of these developments leave any room for trees
      and the Council has changed the character of the area.\r\nThis development will
      also add to the traffic problem - it is very difficult to drive in from Mitcham
      Road and / or Park Road due to the traffic and parked cars.   I have had to
      wait up to 10 minutes while cars from the other direction can get through due
      to the volume and parked cars on both sides of the street.  This is resulting
      in an overdevelopment and destroying the area.\r\n"

        Dear Lynn,

        I do not consider the time frame you consider to reply is reasonable. In the last two business days whilst in Council I have been trying to investigate your query in regards to the Post Office building being redeveloped. The shopping centre is known as Bay Village Shopping Centre, being Lot 1 on SP143388, 2-8 Stradbroke Street Redland Bay. I have searched the council's internal data base and have been unable to find any development application which is current. Applications were lodged in February 2017 for the Dominos shop refit and the latest application, in March, relate to advertising.
        I have sent a request to officers to advise if there is an application that has been received and not yet recorded within the Councils data base system. I do not expect an immediate response from officers. If I am advised of a redevelopment application then I shall Advise you.

        Regards,

        Mark

      Place which at the time was a lovely area. The traffic noise on Queen Street
      has increased so much that I now have my house on the market (not that it is
      likely to sell). Motor bikes are seriously loud and I am not sure to whom to
      complain or even if anything would be done to help. This increase in traffic
      is partially as a result of high density housing in the area. I agree with others
      that quality of life is looking bleak for people in Redland Bay,

      people who have purchased or rent homes in the area do so because of it’s location,
      less dense living and appreciation for the foliage and natural wildlife. Do
      not approve this application. Do not negatively impact the greenwedge, home
      owners and the already existing revitalization to this area. Please listen to
      the community!\r\n"

    text: "I wish to draw attention to the access to 157 Glenfern Road. An entry to
      a caravan park here is most unsafe and is highly likely to increase road accidents.
      It is on a hill, not far from a busy controlled intersection. \r\n\r\nComing
      down the hill, cars have just left an 80 km/h speed zone. Turning into the service
      road a car and caravan would need to make a 180 degree turn.\r\nComing up the
      hill, it is possible to miss the entry to the service road and overshoot. \r\nGlenfern
      Road / Lysterfield Road / Napoleon Road is a very busy intersection and Caravan
      Park entry so close will cause confusion.\r\n\r\nThe turn into the service road
      is regularly in need of maintenance after heavy rain which sends stones across
      the bitumen. The service road is not wide enough for a thoroughfare of cars
      and caravans.\r\nThe other entry to the property is via Bellair Avenue, a quiet
      residential street and environs."

      given over riding approval for a caravan park.\r\nThe lengthy negotiations with
      Council and the difficulties in satisfying the Council's requirements effecting
      the original five lot development, plus the objections raised by local residents
      at that time, should logically rule out a caravan park with its many more residents

    text: "This is outrageous!!! I have a property that backs on to this land. We
      as local residents all opposed the sale when this land was subdivided with the
      support of Knox Council. The only way that this went through was a fight through
      VCAT, which stipulated a land donation to Knox council, that only one dwelling
      be built on the land (and that had to be built in a section of the property
      that was up close to Glenfern Road), and that there was no way the property
      could be further sub-divided.\r\nNow what is Knox council doing?\r\nThis is
      the wrong place for a caravan park... Upsetting the beautiful green-belt, the
      local flora and fauna, not to mention the upset to the traffic conditions in
      the area, the increased noise, the risk for fire, the lay of the land which
      is totally unsuitable for caravans and the pollution of the beautiful creek.\r\nKnox
      council has recently closed a caravan park in their shire, that was in a suitable
      location, just to help out the greedy developers. This it unacceptable.\r\n"

    text: "Hi, \r\nThere are 2 reasons why we are objecting to the development - \r\n1/
      There is already considerable traffic on Grandview Ave due to Antonine College
      being a few houses away. The school teachers/parents/visitors park all along
      the street making it very difficult to drive down the street. The width of the
      street is not conductive to high traffic with cars parked on either side. \r\nThere
      has been a increase in accidents in the street recently, one that nearly hit
      a child. \r\nCar mirrors are regularly hit as cars are trying to drive through
      the street. \r\nOn any given day or evening the street parking is nearly full.
      I regularly have visitors complaining that they had to park a block away. \r\nIt
      would be extremely negligent to further increase the need for people to park
      on the street and add to this congestion for 1 person's financial gain. \r\n2/
      The construction of 2 townhouses on this block, which is not a corner block
      would set precedence to build high density dwellings. This will alter the street
      scape considerably and decrease house prices. \r\nThese dwellings should have
      provisions for parking make within their house block. "

        Thank you for your email. Rest assured I will definitely voice your concerns with the officers and Councillors. I will advocate and relay your comments and do whatever I can to ensure your concerns are raised. I agree with you comments and I too have issues in my own street in Pascoe Vale South.

        My only issue is, if the application meets the state government guidelines there isn't much I can do except voice your concerns and that of mine.

        Once again I appreciate your email and empathise with you.

    text: "Is this a joke? \r\nI’m not against development but once again Hobart City
      Council I don’t believe this should be a well considered community development
      proposal! \r\nThe Lenna Hotel at Salamanca, Tasmania have lodged a development
      with Hobart City Council wanting to build a 10 storey hotel over their existing
      carpark and attached to the existing 5 storey heritage hotel. THIS is just plain
      and simple greedy development. Not to mention poor traffic management plan.
      Presently, traffic flow (vehicle and pedestrian) are congested almost 24/7.
      This will only increase existing risks & jam. \r\nRemember there is the historic
      Lady Gowrie childcare centre opposite and adjacent to what you want to build
      onto...when they play outside or look out their windows these kids and staff
      don’t need to look at such a concrete monster! \r\nAnother thing to be mindful
      of - Battery Point and Salamanca are residential and tourist village sharing
      areas NOT New York City or London mega cities. \r\nPlease half the height and
      make the boundary setbacks to an acceptable breathable visual. Make this Development
      at best smaller than the existing buildings. Finally, If people involved at
      every level of these ideas & reality  I.e proposal, financing & approving were
      made to live amongst their decision we would not have such insensitive & stupid
      situations to deal with.\r\n\r\n"

        Michael, there are 3 councillors with the name of Paul and I think you may have the wrong one. I also never spoke about the vehicle (that was spoken about by Cr Paul Golle).
        I spoke against ‘Rooming Accomodation’  as a planning instrument but wasn’t the councillor that made comment(S) about the tenants (most of the personal comments were made by Cr Lance Hewlett).
        I encourage you to rewatch the video online.

      to neighbours both within the complex and to the neighbouring complex, is far
      too close.\r\nI am concerned about the extra traffic entering Sturgeon Street
      from the new development.  \r\nResidents already living nearby do not want the
      road to become even busier.  \r\nNeither do I want to see the road widened to
      cope with the traffic which would involve knocking down mature trees and encroaching
      on Fellmonger Park.\r\nKoala's often seen previously in Fellmonger Park opposite
      have disappeared over the past 2 years.  \r\nOverdevelopment of land with units

        Hi Corrine,

        I’m not sure where this application is at exactly. They have approvals in place already, but I believe they are going to try and amend part of them in the near future??

        The road connection taking Oliva Street through to Cedar Rd is something that was always in the plans, once a DA was acted on at this property? I believe it is actually in the State’s LGIP plans, as well as Council’s so I am not sure what - if anything - can be done here.

        I will look into this more over the coming months and as things progress and will also see if there’s any opportunity not to have it go through. I just don’t want to make a false commitment to you, as I believe it may already be a ‘done deal’??

        I will get back to you soon. Feel free to call me if I take too long.

        Best regards,

      Beach, being seriously considered by the planning department and a precedent
      set. The attraction for residence and tourism here is expressly due to the low
      density, well considered "lower than a palm tree" (aka, not more than 4 stories)
      rule of thumb set some time ago. Nothing against the Gold Coast or Brisbane,
      but if we wanted to live in (or tourists wanted to visit) that kind of hign

      (from Holloways to Ellis) is an area of extreme natural beauty as well as sensitive
      coastline. Increasing the height-density by way of high storied development
      is a huge and irretrievable step in the wrong direction...anywhere along the
      this coast; and an enormous eyesore. Please pay attention to what we are saying.
      We don't want it and its a huge mistake.

        layout shows a connection from Cedar Road to Oliva Street.\n\nThe current
        MCU application (CRC online reference 8176/2017) was lodged in October 2017
        and is currently within the response to Information Request stage.  I note
        that Council has recently agreed to extend the response period until August

        to provide their comments on the proposed development.  At this stage, I do

        has to be after a response is provided to the Information Request.  Notification
        will occur in the standard manner i.e. ad in the paper, notice on the land

    text: "This is not in keeping with what the land is zoned for.  From what I understand
      this is for dwelling of up to 2 stories high.  So far for Palm Cove units are
      only supposed to be four stories high and not higher that the palm trees.\r\nThe
      opening of Oliva street will be fought by me.  There is no reason for it to
      be opened - it will create all types of traffic  added to Veivers Road and into
      Oliva St.  If there ever is anything to be developed there simply entering and
      exiting via Cedar Road is more appropriate and a lot less people will be affected.
      \ I know it is marked to open but bad decisions can be reversed.  \r\nPeople
      come to Palm Cove to live and holiday because of how it is with no over development.
      \ This must not be underestimated by approving high rise developments.  The
      only people to benefit from this will be the developers.\r\nIt is frightening
      these developers are spending money on this proposal - why do they think there
      is a chance?\r\n"

    text: This is just part of the 'redevelopment' of the Queen Victoria Market. This
      quaint little strip of shops and small businesses may not be the epitome of
      elegant heritage architecture, but it represents character, history and smallness;
      the Doyle-dominated MCC wishes to replace these with a shopping mall experience
      which will be vast, soul-less and sterile, like the horrible crop of massive
      skyscrapers now towering over the market section of Elizabeth Street. This will
      represent only the victory of commercial interests/the profit motive over real
      people of Melbourne and their real, historic market. The Development-MCC-State
      Government nexus - apparently the only party in favour of this demolition/'redevelopment'
      - is bringing about the complete ruination of Melbourne. There is absolutely
      nothing in this demolition for ordinary citizens and QVM patrons; there are
      more than enough architectural abominations in the area of the market already.
      I have voted for the Greens at all levels of government; I hope that there is
      some way to prevent this atrocity and others to come.

        Dear Sahar

        This is not a council proposal, council is the planning authority dealing with the application lodged by the proponent.

        This waste facility not not owned or run by council.

        The application seeks retrospective approval for the previous overfill which occurred in 2015, and is not seeking to add more waste that is in there today or to reopen the landfill.

        The overfill is located on the southern portion of the site, the sandy looking hill near the park. In reality the appearance would change by moving that existing hill of landfill close to the park more to the rear (north) and make it slightly lower than it appears today, and then to landscape it.

        The application information can be found here:

      is a mattress, dinning chairs, cans of paint, an abandoned trailer with rubbish

    text: 'I would like to add my objection to the reduction in parking. There is
      a reason for the parking requirements for every development. If the council
      want to change these parameters they need to do their due diligence and assess
      the reasons for why these were originally put place (by previous council members
      who have clearly moved on). Changes to planning policy should go through due
      diligence whereby the appropriate channels, assessment and community feedback
      is involved.  They allow a "dispensation" of these requirements for EVERY development
      and by doing so negate the point of why these restrictions were put in place.
      The cumulative effect has already severely reduced the amenity of the inner
      north. This development and the dispensation of parking will turn Nicholson
      Street into Punt Road, creating more issues in the future. Developers will continue
      to develop irrespective as to whether they have to provide the required car
      spaces - why are council so weak when it comes to dealing with property developers
      and pander to their every request?? There needs to be far more vision and respect
      for the community and the livability of our city. Council, instead of pandering
      to developers should be keeping them accountable - building permits for inner
      city developments should not only provide adequate parking AS PER COUNCIL''S
      OWN POLICIES, they also need to have grey water plumbing / solar panels and
      % of green flora integrated within the design to offset the environmental impact
      of excessive development. Council has once again failed the community. '

    text: I would be interested in the City of Melbourne conducting an analysis of
      all the applications which have sought to reduce car parking requirements. I
      believe there are more instances of exemption than compliance, which would seem
      to make the policy somewhat ineffective in controlling what it is intended to.

      text: "Many thanks Lisa\n\nWithout commenting on the application for 22 Thompson
        St (I haven't seen the plans yet), I can generally indicate that the car parking
        particular provision is a state-wide provision without local variation in
        Kensington, and is indeed often waived given the historical lack of off-street
        car-parking in such an old suburb. A mandatory provision would result in massive
        changes to heritage streetscapes, and in many cases, needless expense that
        inflates the cost of building and home purchase. Car ownership is of course
        lower here than in the outer suburbs.\n\nWhile we don't collect data on the
        number of times that exemption or variation of the planning scheme car parking
        requirements is *applied* for, and each application is assessed on the particular
        circumstances for each individual site as is required by the Planning Scheme
        (each time with input from Council's traffic engineers), we do conduct regular
        traffic and parking counts across different parts of the municipality and
        anticipate new demands on road space created by new proposals. It is important
        to note that many permits are not acted on, but if acted on we don't always
        know when construction will conclude and a new car-owning resident will move
        in, so we can't seek to manage road space demands through the planning system
        alone.\n\nThe parking overlay - which can vary the requirements of the parking
        particular provision - is applied in some parts of the municipality outside
        of Kensington, and may have utility in Kensington in future. A review of road
        space can potentially be picked up in the Transport Strategy refresh which
        has just started, and a review of the planning controls, while less likely
        in the near future, could be addressed in the upcoming review of the planning
        scheme required to be undertaken by Council early in the term. Happy to elaborate
        more - feel free to call! 03 9658 9051.\n\nAll the best,\n\nRohan\n\nThis
        email is intended solely for the named addressee. \nIf you are not the addressee

      \r\n\r\nI purchased my first home 2.5 years ago, and one of the big reasons
      that i elected to move into Bellbird Park was the character and charm of the
      area. This development would change the area in a negative way. \r\n\r\nit would
      affect the traffic network due to increase number of vehicles on the roads (especially
      given the lack of public transport in the area). this would in turn increase
      my commute to and from work. \r\n\r\nof great concern to me is that it would
      also affect the native wildlife that also call Bellbird Park home. I really
      enjoy sharing my corner of Ipswich with the Koala's, wallabies and other native
      wildlife living in the area. \r\n\r\nFinally, i am concerned with the way this
      development will affect my property in severe weather conditions (e.g. floods)
      clearing the bushland  could negatively impact the streets ability to handle
      these weather events. \r\n\r\nI urge you to reject the development proposal
      and help myself and the other residents continue to enjoy a good quality of
      life that encouraged us to move to the area in the first place. "

    text: "Sean Deany\r\nPO Box 101\r\nFitzroy Vic 3065\r\nM: 0490444129\r\n\r\nDear
      Yarra Ranges Planning Authority,\r\n\r\nIt comes to my attention that the large
      residence located at 23 Hawthory Rd / corner of Loch Street Kilsyth has recently
      been sold and has been proposed and approved for redevelopment. As a former
      resident of Kilsyth (1968 - 1988) and still having family members living in
      Lomond Ave, in the vicinity of the above property, I wish to raise my deepest
      concerns.\r\n\r\nThe very location of this mentioned property at 23 Hawthory
      Rd and the adjoining blocks at 25 Hawthory Rd, built on in 2009, and 17 Loch
      Street with existing 1960s brick veneer residence are indeed on the site of
      the former home of the late 19th century Australian landscape painter James
      Alfred Turner - a contemporary of the Heidelberg School of artist. JA Turner
      lived at Kilsyth from 1888 - 1908 in a former orchards residence named The Gables
      where many of his popular and best know landscape painting were made in his
      studio on site. To my knowledge there has been some misunderstanding to the
      precise location of this famous artist residence due to primarily second generational
      oral history being one of the basis's for this. Many residents of Kilsyth believe
      that the Gables was located in Crinan Street. However recently with the aid
      of heritage material in the form of hard data such as a 1900s high resolution
      photographic view of Kilsyth where the Gables is visible from a distance and
      where there is no other structures visible in the vacinity of Crinan Street:
      c1916 topographical mapping where the placement of the Gables residence is titled
      on land adjacent to modern day alignment of Hawthory Rd and a December 1983
      aerial photograph which indicates the former Gables footprint evident based
      on a scenario I have made of the actual residence dimensions. \r\n\r\nWhile
      the Gables residence has long gone in its structural form (1960) there is indeed
      a lasting legacy of cultural important for community. I strongly believe that
      there should be first a preliminary ground penetrating survey of the site and
      along with access to historical aerial imagery from the 1952 - 60 Australian
      Aerial survey, which can be obtainable from the State Archives. These two undertakings
      will verify the exact location of the Gables.\r\n\r\nLastly and due to the recent
      zoning law changes and the increased redevelopment of Kilsyth into a medium
      density suburb, which I don't have any objection to, I am however very concerned
      of the rapidly disappearing built and environmental heritage of this apparently
      unremarkable outer suburb.\r\n\r\nIdeally the suburban blocks at 23 and even
      25 Hawthory Rd., as well as 17 Loch Street, Kilsyth, should be quarantined from
      any further development until full verification of the former residence of JA
      Turner has been located through available survey technology. Lastly if the given
      site mentioned above is fully verified to having been the site of JA Turner's
      residence the Gables I believe that this puts forward a strong case for its
      preservation and possible enhancement as a possible museum or heritage park
      thus putting the suburb of Kilsyth in higher regards for cultural importance
      and indeed an asset for the numbers of new residents living in the area.\r\n\r\nI
      would be happy to provide copies of the existing hard data verifying to my best
      of knowledge the actual site of the gables proving that it did indeed stand
      where the above mentioned property at 23 Hawthory Rd Kilsyth is soon to be redeveloped.\r\n\r\nLook
      forward to your response soon.\r\n\r\nSean Deany (former resident of Kilsyth)

      6am-6pm Monday to Friday.\r\n\r\nWe are opposed to this development not only
      because of the fact that this is a residential neighbourhood & it is NOT a commercial
      area. When you look at the traffic report there are 24 car parking spaces. This
      is inadequate given the number of children that they are proposing to attend
      this centre which when you have 120 kids attending the centre with an average
      of 2 kids to a family means you need around 60 car spaces to be an adequate
      number of car parking with children's safety being a key factor as if we were
      to attend this child care centre I would not like to be getting my child out
      on a busy side ride where with the increased traffic volume comes a higher accident
      risk and then there is the office entry on McIlwraith Road. I can guarantee
      most of the cars will be parked up and down the street blocking residents getting
      out of their properties and causing traffic congestion in and out of Youngs
      Crossing Road. This will increase in the accident side of things and maybe Children
      & Adults both getting injured. Even if there is traffic lights or not!\r\nWith
      the size of landscaping designed this means all trees will be gone & this is
      one of the attractions to this neighbourhood & one of the many reasons our local
      neighbours brought in this area because of the relaxed open planned living &
      the peace & quiet lifestyle and it would mean minimal area for the children's
      out door play space. This sort of proposal should be moved to a bigger block
      further off the main road or to adjoining suburbs possibly near the ever growing
      Genesis college. This should be a single storey development as there are no

    text: My concerns that the increase of traffic in McIllwraith road will change
      the quite residential st that it is now to a busy road that will create traffic
      to bank up onto youngs crossing rd . The traffic signal proposal by council
      will only go in when the youngs crossing bridge gets built. My understanding
      is that's still on the long term 10 year plan. We are opposed to this being
      built and change of residential zone.

    text: This Application is in an area of Toowoomba that is very well known for
      its beautiful character homes on spacious, leafy blocks.  Similar to other early
      Toowoomba suburbs, many of the houses in this part of South Toowoomba are very
      old and add to the suburb's unique heritage and character.  In raising this
      topic, it is interesting to note that in September 2015, the TRC Councillors
      voted to reject a Development Application for some units on Bridge Street in
      East Toowoomba in circumstances where Council Officers had recommended that
      the Application be approved.  In referring specifically to the importance of
      the "character" of the area in rejecting the Application, the Mayor stated as
      reported in the Toowoomba Chronicle on 8 September, 2015, "We need to make absolutely
      sure that we keep the neighborhood areas in the way they ought to be."  "People
      will not come to Toowoomba in the future to live in small buildings within a
      good neighborhood area."  "They'll come here to live in area which has real
      character."  "By refusing this, we're drawing a line in the sand and we're prepared
      to make a stand and keep that neighborhood character."  I would very much like
      to think that the argument the TRC Councilors used in rejecting the East Toowoomba
      Development Application will be given exactly the same weight when this South
      Toowoomba Application is considered.  That would only be fair.

      in this area they would be aware of numerous issues : parking in Cranley St

      centre staff staff parking on South and Geddes Streets makes the nearby roundabout
      dangerous. When will this council use some forward thinking in their development

        Thank you Fran, an owner of a building can lodge a development application at any time. Usually this will be accompanied by an engineer's report that describes the building as unsound. If the building were non -contributory the demolition approval would follow. c
        Clearly this one is contributory. Depending on the engineers report Council staff can approve or ask the CDP to assess the application. The latter would be publicly notified. The cottage is beautiful  but Council can only assess what it has before them. Happy to discuss. My phone number is on my blog at www.jennieboisvert.com.

    text: "Hi Oscar,\r\nIn addition to the legitimate concerns of residents in the
      immediate vicinity of this proposed development, can Council planning please
      also consider those of the wider Pascoe Vale & Moreland communities:\r\n\r\n1.
      Traffic in O'Hea Street has increased exponentially since the opening of the
      Coburg North Coles center which (while an overall positive development in my
      opinion) has gridlocked the Gaffney & Sussex Street intersection. O'Hea Street
      has now become a major vehicle thoroughfare for transiting east - west traffic
      in the area.\r\n\r\n2. As a daily bicycle commuter into the CBD, I find that
      the existing O'Hea Street bicycle track is by far the safest east - west passage
      between Pascoe Vale and the Upfield bicycle track. \r\n\r\nThere are a growing
      number of incidences of vehicles being parked across the O'Hea Street bicycle
      track between the driveway and curb due to lack of on street parking caused
      by the issues noted in earlier comments. This forces bicycle commuters to deviate
      off the path into the O'Hea Street traffic.\r\nFurther multi-dwelling developments
      with parking reductions will only exacerbate this issue at a time when provision
      of safe and practical bicycle routes should be a priority to help ease the traffic
      burden as Moreland & Melbourne's population grows.\r\n\r\nI am sure that these
      issues will be important to you as a local resident as well as a Councillor.\r\n\r\nThank
      you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nBill Davis"

        I can assure you that Council too acknowledges these problems. I will again raise this with the relevant Director and Manager. I should point out Bill that we will shortly erect speed humps down a section of O’Heas Street to mitigate some of the issues.

        Once again I appreciate you voicing your concerns with me.

        Regards

        Cr. Oscar Yildiz JP

      is so busy with the growing school population at the primary school as well
      as the kindergarten. On Saturdays there is also the farmers' market and the
      O'Hea Bakery is very busy with many of the patrons travelling by car. I urge
      the Council to enforce the require visitor car parking requirements for this
      proposal.\r\n\r\nI see from the boards outside that the five town houses are
      to be built over two house lots not one."

    text: 'How do these development proposals get through Council?? How can anyone
      think that one house block can accommodate five townhouses and what is the rationale
      for reducing visitor car spaces. O''Hea Street is drowning under the current
      level of traffic congestion which is a hazard for children and the elderly trying
      to negotiate their way across the street, as well as people trying to join the
      carriageway from the adjoining side streets. O''Hea Street and other similar

      are left to circle the block endlessly until someone leaves...........crazy!   This
      is dangerous, and the council needs to realise that it just cannot approve even
      a single request for reduced parking from any site, no matter what the given
      reason.   We need more, not less parking in every street, since today vehicles
      park on both sides of even skinny roads - leaving no room for anyone to pass,
      and a real problem for the bigger emergency vehicles.

      people's eyes globally, even on the news, whether those apartments are being
      built for living or just pure drive to fattening the building developers' belly
      which might turn out to be a bad debt and burden to the society  as a whole
      in the future?  If Australia is purely driving the economic growth through building
      more apartment, then I really have a deep concern on the Australia future.  As
      I can see the Australia is following the steps of China with building more building,
      and turns into building bubble, as Chinese government realized, hence more tough
      regulations are out to curb the economic crisis. Is Australia government realize
      the issue? Are government officials doing something about it? \r\n\r\nMelbourne
      is a multi-cultural city, especially city centre is the representation of Melbourne
      as a whole to the world, people are attracted visiting Melbourne for a variety
      of reasons. To become a global city, careful consideration of planning the use

      the only remaining large gums on the block and it's important that they remain

      clearly the majority of Australians, even in tiny apartments, own cars. Not
      mention the visitors that they may attract. The current request a waiver in
      the loading bay requirement too. How do they expect deliveries to be made to
      the shop at the base of the development? Any business needs deliveries and Nicholson
      Street has constant traffic requiring a loading bay, preferably easily accessible
      so that it does not block traffic or detrimentally affect other local businesses.\r\nI
      have no problem with some of the developments that are occurring in our area
      but we have just about reached a peak. People have to live somewhere and it
      is better not to destroy Melbourne's green belt. However.....it is essential
      that the ambience of this area is maintained and that the small cafes and shops
      are not dwarfed by the huge apartment blocks. There is a great sense of community
      in North Fitzroy but too many of these vast developments could put paid to that.
      Most of the apartments going up are not taking green land they are replacing
      old warehouses etc but wouldn't this be a great opportunity to insist on areas
      of green be incorporated within them? Surely the benefits to the environment
      and the residents of the apartments is obvious. Getting that to happen may well
      take a bit of brave leadership from our council......??!"

      the dangers for walkings and cyclists. Give us a break. This was a happy, vibrant
      neighbourhood with a trendy edge, which was filled with unique businesses, groovy
      cafes, flower gardens, street events, cricket matches on side streets, and happy—SAFER
      cyclists. Now it is a car-dense, speed crazy, fume polluted, vehicle cluttered
      landscape lined with high rises where the wind chills the walking and the vista
      is pitiful—ugly. The charm has been consumed. The number of people that are
      accommodated in these buildings is staggering—1,000s are pouring into our hood,
      all supported by high rises that fill every square inch of land, no trees, just
      tiny ornamental lawns featuring ornamental shrubs. No food for wildlife. We
      have cars parked in our streets for weeks and weeks on end while their owners
      go on holidays, because they either have not got off street car parking or they
      just don''t want to pay for it. This reduces the usability of the street parking
      for all residents!! We like having people around, and we really like to have
      cyclists. But, with such short-sighted urban planning at council level, these
      developments are changing our hood way too quickly and not for the better. '

      overshadowing policy. The same property is also overshadowed on its easy side
      by a development built up by 600mm height with a resulting 2500mm high fence
      on the boundary. ALL boundaries surrounding this property were originally at
      the same level as this property before development approvals.. This screen was
      erected along the FRONT fence of the affected property without development approval
      and despite the owners objection of having 3 sides of their property now overshadowed
      because of  developments and current council policies this retrospective-application
      for approval is a ''rubber stamp'' approval process. The remainder of this boundary
      fence ( front fence) of the affected property has also been overshadowed by
      the carport of 29 Pemberton street as the carport has had solid material attached
      to the sides above fence height within about 20cm from the fence at a height
      well above 2100mm without development approval and is seeking retrospective
      approval. This is simply NOT JUST that a property is screened off and overshadowed
      on THREE sides by ridiculous structures and development policies. How can development
      policies allow this to happen. ALL council applications should consider how
      the properties sharing boundaries with an application are already affected by
      development instead of just approving applications in isolation just assessing  the
      policies relevant to the actual application. Councils used to attend sites and
      visually inspect the impact on neighboring properties before they approved anything.
      How fair is it for a property to be overshadowed on 3 sides in a ''low to medium''
      density neighborhood? This is simply unsatisfactory!! The property that is affected
      by this ''privacy  screen'' application is also on the LOWER side of the fence
      line!!! '

        Hi Shantha,

        Thank you for your enquiry.

        A developer can apply for a permit to include a waiver of car parking requirements. I notice that quite often, Council receives a request from the developer to waive some or all of the car parking requirements.

        However, just because that is what is applied for, that doesn’t mean Council will necessarily approve that. In some circumstances we may approve the permit but ask for the full complement of car parking, or refuse the permit altogether.

        In most cases, the difficulty with parking comes from sites where the car parking quotas have actually been met, but users choose to park on the street instead, or have more cars than what is provided on site and this causes the congestion.

        With a 2 bedroom house needing one space and a 3+ bedroom only needing two spaces, there are many occasions where the correct amount is woefully inadequate particularly when you start to look at larger multi-unit developments.

        Council has no opportunity to impose greater car parking requirements than those quotas mentioned above, which are set by the state government.

        I share your concerns around what the increase in development has meant for road safety, congestion and ease of parking, and I have been working with Council on initiatives that seek to increase ease of movement around the city and encourage more investment in public transport.

        Kind Regards

      notice to council that the development did not adhere to the plans that had
      been approved. After some months of repeatedly following this up with very little
      council interest in the matter, the developer finally returned to plant some
      olive trees. That's it! No mention of the wrong materials being used, overlooking
      windows not being screened, heights not matching plans... what can you do when
      the planning authority doesn't ensure that the plans mean anything?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
      after 11 years of living on Nicholson Street I've moved out of the suburb, we
      just couldn't deal with living in a permanent building site any more. It's really

    text: Why do Knox Council continually ask for planning permits for trees that
      are not indigenous to Victoria, such as this one. This tree belongs in the rainforests
      of NSW and QLD. Another tree i see frequently requiring a planning permit from
      Knox Council is Grevlliea robusta, this also doesn't require a permit to remove.
      Not to mention all the pine trees i see that require a permit. The only time
      a planning permit is required is when indigenous vegetation is being removed.  Knox
      Council should ensure their staff know what is indigenous to Victoria and what
      isn't.

      Barker Street and more to come egress and ingress is already a problem due to
      reduced parking requirements in the new developments. We are already reduced

      construction workers and resident parking, it will be impossible to get in and

      forced to sell to the developers because their neighbors have sold or because
      of developments which over shadow their properties. It was a great place to
      live because of it's proximity to Southland, public transport and the local
      shopping strip, which is why the developers have moved in.\r\nThere has been
      no improvements to the infrastructure due to the increase in the number of residents
      now living in a very small area.\r\nI understand the need for development, but

    text: "Astrid, \r\naccording to <landchecker.com.au/property-report/402353>  this
      property has an area of 561sqm.  With the new Victorian planning laws released
      earlier this year, there is no longer a cap on the number of dwellings on a
      single lot (you can read more details on this site http://bit.ly/2lENcmD).  \r\nHowever,
      there are some increased restrictions, such as 'blocks 501-600sqm will need
      30 per cent garden space' (typically including boundary setbacks), which leaves
      roughly 392sqm to squeeze apartments on.  It is possible to build up to 9m above
      natural ground level / 2 storeys in this zone, or 11m / 3 storeys on the north
      side of Barker street GRZ, and 13.5m in some areas RGZ, (you can review the
      zone map on landchecker if you setup a free account).  \r\nA single storey of
      a building is usually 3-3.5m from floor to floor, garages are ~2.5-3m, roof
      decks can fit in 1-1.7m.  Given it is a fairly flat site, they will probably
      need a basement for carparking, and with the Better Apartment Guidelines released
      recently (https://www.vic.gov.au/news/apartment-design-guidelines.html), it
      is hard to see how they will get so many onto such an average size block, though
      without being able to view the plans it's hard to know.  \r\nThe reduced amenity,
      especially street parking is almost certainly going to be dire, given most people
      who have offstreet parking use it for storage and park on the street instead,
      (Per 2011 Census,  in the City of Kingston there is an average 2.4 persons and
      2.9 cars per dwelling, yet the planning department insists street parking is
      not an issue http://bit.ly/2h3nAhU), Add to that it is a narrow street, with
      many high density developments likely to start in this area.\r\nClearly this
      development is entirely against the spirit of recent state planning legislation,
      but the developer is likely aiming for a swift rejection by council, so they
      can go straight to VCAT and avoid the most lengthy, and inefficient part of
      the planning process, which more often than not overlooks many planning issues
      and conditions (that local government would raise) and avoids dealing with most
      neighbourhood concerns.\r\nMy advice, if you live in this part of Kingston is
      to sell, because the outlook is pretty bleak.\r\n"

        Hi Astrid & Rodriguez, I have been asked to provide you with a response to your query regarding 12 Barker Street in Cheltenham.

        Please be advised that a development at No's 12 and 14 Barker Street, comprising 19 dwellings within a 4 storey apartment building, plus a basement, was approved by Council earlier this year. The site is located within an Activity Centre Zone pursuant to the Kingston Planning Scheme. The proposal was advertised and 3 objections were received. Accordingly, a Planning Consultation meeting was organised and held with the objectors, the applicant, Ward Councillor(s) and officers attending. Some matters were resolved as a result of this process and one of the objections was withdrawn. After fully considering the application, Council issued a Notice of Decision to Grant a Permit for the proposal on 21 July 2017. There were no appeals lodged and after the required time, Council issued a Planning Permit for the proposal on 29 August 2017.

        The building has a height of approximately 13 metres, is fully compliant with on-site car parking requirements and is consistent with other similar and approved developments within the Activity Centre Zone. This area is one that has and is changing, primarily allowing for a wider range of housing types to increase housing diversity and to cater for the changing needs of current and future populations and is encouraged within activity centres, subject to appropriate design.

        Hope this information is of assistance.

        Regards, Ian Nice.

      to Lots 49, 59, and 67 Creek Road Burpengary East, Austcorp No 903, cleared
      the land late 2016, decimating habitats of both flora and fauna including possible
      injury to a Koala (Protected Species) and left other fauna in shock or worse!
      There was an abundance of raptors whose feeding ground was in and around that
      area and as time passes, these wonderful creatures are being driven away; it
      has been said that developers only care about money than the beauty of flora
      and fauna God gave us and developers hope to make them extinct!\r\n\r\nAustcorp
      No 903, are elevating we feel, a road system through said lots, with little
      or no concern over the fauna that has returned since they desisted development
      in 2016. Too, there has been little concern shown in regard to dust caused by
      the present development and no water tankers on site to keep the dust down,
      again showing disregard to those who live nearby!\r\n\r\nWe believe also that
      the dwellings to be built from the fence line of Pacific Palms Village was supposed
      to be 3 metres and a request by the developer has been made to reduce that down
      to 2 metres is not acceptable; We have just found out that Austcorp No 903 has
      put forward new plans to Morton Bay Regional Council and Council has approved
      said plans without public input; no signage has been shown on Creek Road as
      to this new development and it seems little has been of concern to injury to
      fauna or damage to flora previously by Austcorp No 903 with all proof of said
      acts sent to both the Minister of the Environment State and Federal, information
      sent resulted in phone calls from both ministers that action would be taken
      against the developer in both cases! No wonder so many species of flora and
      fauna are now extinct!\r\n\r\nSadly, being elderly tends to make politicians
      ignore us, and as one senior minister told asked me, \"How soon can you die
      off, you elderly are a waste of time!\" and that told us what some think of
      us elderly pensioners!\r\n"

    text: As local residents we are opposed to this development due to its commercial
      nature and proximity to nearby houses.  Located on a hill, surrounded by housing,
      we believe it will bring unacceptable noise, light and traffic problems that
      will severely affect the amenity of the area and making living nearby extremely
      unappealing (would you want every weekend disrupted by this next to your house?).  The
      location is completely unsuitable for so many reasons and it is disturbing to
      think that it may be thought an acceptable solution for this highly residential
      neighbourhood. Furthermore Kundes Road (the only access road) is a non-through
      residential road for locals and is unsuited to commercial or non-local traffic
      due to the lack of decent verges, footpaths, and it's use as a bike and walking
      area for local kids attending the primary school and kindy.  While not opposed
      to development per se, this one is just all wrong for this area.

      'reduced car parking'.  What a good idea, let's all park in the street.    It's
      impossible to drive down a street without having to wait for other cars to pass.   Not
      to mention to STRESS ON OUR SERVICES with all of this increased development.    Councillors

      be a strain on services in the area. Schools, doctors, crime etc, and for some
      reason businesses aren't exactly doing to well at the shopping centre."

    text: This is not clear to me as to where the proposed parking is to be located.
      I am hoping that it is in the carpark off the Field Street entrance. The current
      carpark with the entrance off the Main Road is poorly designed and difficult
      enough now to negotiate without adding caravans and mobile homes to the mix.
      Will you clarify for me please so I can make the appropriate comments to the
      planning authority, if necessary.

        Apologies about the delay in responding.  Below is response from staff to your enquiry;

        "Dear Cr Kilby

        The following information has been provided by Steve Tilbrook, Team Leader (Planning) in relation to your enquiry:

        Thank you for your email dated 21 October 2017 on behalf of Ms Helen Blake in relation to Development Application 145/2772/2017 for a variation to DA 145/1674/2012 - alteration of northern carpark for short term RV parking at 130 Main Road, McLaren Vale.

        The proposed RV parking area is located in the northern Coles carpark accessed from Field Street. The proposed plan provides room for up to five RV parking spaces located along the western property boundary. Signage is proposed that limits RV users to stay for 24 hours maximum. Four signs are proposed in total, two located on site where the RV parking is located, one at the entrance point on Field Street and one located at the junction of Field Street and Main Road directing people to the RV parking location.

        Ms Blake can contact the assessing officer Steve Tilbrook, Team Leader (Planning) on 8384 0710 or  to discuss the application or view the plans.

        Please respond  via  if you have any further questions.

        I will leave it to you to forward the above response to the resident."

      text: "Hi Skye,\n\nFirstly thanks forgetting in touch regarding this planning
        application.\n\n\nI have sought more information from our planners in regards
        to this and as this is a rather new app (Sept 21 submitted) the details are
        still coming through.\n\n\nI will keep a keen eye on this application but
        at this time I hope you appreciate that I am not able to comment. Under recent
        court rulings if Councillors show any bias to one argument over another until
        all information is received that their vote could be invalid and challenged
        at VCAT.\n\n\nSo as such I will reserve my judgement.\n\n\nHowever, what I
        will say is that I will make a decision if this comes to full council meeting
        based on what is appropriate for the general residential (zone 2) area along
        with a number of other principals as outlined in the Victorian and Knox Planning
        Scheme documents.\n\n\nKnox Council recently conducted our housing strategy
        which was implemented in early 2016 into the planning scheme and states in
        the zone this development is in that we encourage single and dual occupancy,
        however there is allowance for some townhouse and villa style development
        in blocks of over 1000sq, but this will be dependant on many other variables.\n\n\nI
        myself certainly love the green leafy vibe in Knox and want to ensure we maintain
        the integrity of our residential areas and this plan is one which I will pay
        close attention to as more information comes in.\n\n\nIn reference to your
        comments re the minister designating Wantirna Rd a Residential Growth area
        as per the smart bus route running along same, this was regrettably not asked
        for by Council but a decision made by the Planning Minister. Regardless, we
        will continue to ensure the best possible planning outcomes for the area which
        respect it. Our process to change the planning scheme will nearly always go
        through rigorous community consultation (except when minor changes are made)
        including public exhibition at the Council’s civic centre during that time.\n\n\nPlease
        see attached link to formalise objection (if you haven’t already).\n\n\nhttps://www.knox.vic.gov.au/Files/Planning/Form-ObjectiontoaPlanningApplication.pdf\n\n\nFor
        your information we are also discussing ways to ensure the big end of town
        developers pay their fair share in terms of application fees and their continuing
        to pay in to Knox’s Openspace fund.\n\n\nIf you have any further please don’t
        hesitate to get in touch.\n\n\n\nYours in Kind\n\nJackson\n\n\n[cid:]\n\n\nJackson

    text: Reviewing the amended plans for 23 Gilderthorpe shows that the reduction
      in scope that was requested at the July 11th meeting does not address a large
      number of issues that will have disastrous impacts on surrounding neighbours.
      There are things that only long-term residents or a site visit will reveal,
      going purely off documents put forward by the developer can be misleading. The
      Developer himself said at the Council Meeting “he had never done this before”
      so I hope that you will consider all the issues we have highlighted previously
      should you decide to approve. There must be very strict conditions put in place
      given they are still exceeding the FSR, they are not meeting outdoor space or
      parking ratio and it borders directly opposite a low density area of a heritage
      street of North Randwick. Thank you

    text: "Further to this, construction zones impact on traffic congestion, pedestrian
      and public transport usage where Council turns blind eye. Road access limited
      to one lane for years, footpaths in disrepair or dug up for years, tradesmen
      parked illegally right up to street corners. No flagmen when unloading trucks
      in side roads using forklifts, trucks coming at you to park on wrong side of
      street. \r\nThey are being undertaken by private building surveyors and it seems
      that Council only puts small cost on footpath renewal after the building is
      finished. So we end up with gravel footpaths while developers build which can
      take up to a year. This Is unsuitable access for the aged, vision impaired,
      those with young children, prams and strollers. Or they fence it off and make
      us walk amongst the traffic with plastic bollards and trams wizzing past or
      cross the road at unsuitable places.\r\nBut I suppose Council has different
      rules for builders, their own trucks and us. As we found out the other day when
      a council truck parked right up to intersecting street,  to suck out a drain.
      \ One guy doing the work another eating on the job. We told him we couldn’t
      see to get out of the street. Instead of acting as a flagmen he told us to turn
      left and do a Uturn. We still couldn’t see traffic on the right. Where is OHS! "

      There is nowhere for the customers of new shops to park. This currently has
      two houses on the land which have been there for nearly 100 years now to be
      replaced with an eyesore of a four storey over development. Who wants this-

        Hello Lynette,

        Thank you for your email, dated 17 September about the  POST applications on Planning Alerts. Please be advised that Planning Alerts is not a Council controlled or sponsored application. It simply draws material from Council's electronic planning register.

        The POSTs that Planning Alerts picks up are not new planning applications. Rather Council assigns POST numbers to actions subsequent to the issue of a permit. These might include applications to amend a permit, the lodgement of plans for endorsement or a request to extend the time for commencing or completion of a development.

        In this instance, the POST relates to the lodgement of plans, as required by a planning permit issued in December 2016.

        Hello Lynette
        Good to see you today.
        I have had a look through past emails, and the most recent seem to be about a number of grant opportunities that Council suggested to Greg and Cliff.
        I will forward this on to you for your reference.
        If you could follow up with them about whether they had any luck in their applications that would be helpful.
        I think that I could only ask Council again for funding,  if SHPA were unsuccessful in seeking funding from the sources suggested by Council.
        Regards

        Subject: Anzac Day Dawn Service - grant opportunities

        Dear Jane

        In addition to Council's annual community strengthening grants, there are two other grants that the Surrey Hills Progress Association may wish to consider:

        1.       Commemorative and Education Grant Program - http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/veterans/veterans-grants/victorian-veterans-council-commemoration-and-education-grants-program

        a)       This program provides grants for:

        *       Commemoration and Community Education, and

        *       Education Assistance for Veterans' Dependants.

        Commemoration and Community Education grants provide funding for projects which honour or commemorate the service and sacrifice of veterans and educate Victorians about the contribution made by our veterans in their service to the nation and the state. This could include new war memorials, commemorative events, public education projects and the preservation of wartime heritage.

        Education Assistance for Veterans' Dependants grants provide funding to organisations to assist with the educational needs of veterans' dependants. Organisations wishing to apply for this program must contact the Veterans Branch at Department of Premier and Cabinet on 9651 2202 before submitting an application.

        b)       Grants up to $20,000 (excluding GST) are available.   Grants of up to $10,000 (excluding GST) for commemorative events

        c)        Not for profit organisations that can demonstrate that their principal objective is to provide welfare to the ex-service community are eligible.  Unincorporated organisations may arrange for an    incorporated organisation to act as an auspice on their behalf.

        d)       See the program guidelines<http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/veterans/veterans-grants/victorian-veterans-council-commemoration-and-education-grants-program#programguidelines> for further details including eligible and ineligible projects.

        e)       Opens 2 October 2017 and closes 11 December 2017

        f)        A couple of ANZAC Day ceremonies have been funded in the past.   Applicants have been RSLs but this should not make a difference given the role the Progress Association plays currently

        2.       Victoria Remembers Grant Program - http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/veterans/veterans-grants/victoria-remembers-grant-program

        a)       Program is designed to support major projects which have a significant commemorative or educational benefit.



        b)       Amount: $20,000 to $80,000.  Organisations are expected to contribute at least 20% of the overall expense budget excluding in kind support, private sponsorship or funding from other programs.  Organisations unable to make this contribution are still able to apply but must provide justification for not making this contribution in their application.


        c)       Round 1 - Opens 5 June 2017 and closes 28 August 2017
        Round 2 - Opens 27 November 2017 and closes 12 February 2018


        d)       Successful projects should

        *       raise awareness of the contribution of Victorian veterans, past and present, through diverse, inclusive and educational projects and activities

        *       encourage direct participation and engagement, in making connections with and learning more about past conflicts and the role of veterans

        *       provide social and cultural benefits to the community; and

        *       leave a legacy for future generations.



        e)       NOTE:   recurring activities projects, activities or events held every year will not be funded (e.g. ANZAC Day ceremonies), except where the applicant can demonstrate that funds will be used to include a significant one off component that commemorates a military anniversary (full details of the one off component and a budget breakdown must be included in the application).

        I hope this is of assistance.

        Hello Lynette and Greg
        Congratulations on another wonderful Anzac Day event.
        Thank-you for all the hard work that has gone into organizing this event over the last four years.
        It would be wonderful if Council could take over from here as it seems a pity that such a successful community event will not continue.

        Hello Lynette
        I have asked that a story be included about the Dawn Service in the next Ward Newsletter.
        Tricia, who edits my Newsletter, has asked if you have a suitable photo that could be included.
        Also if there is anything in particular that you would like to be said could you please let us know. I wondered about the emphasis of the article being on the involvement of local children and how they play such an active part in the service. I know we spoke about how important it is to get the next generation involved and interested. I would also like to acknowledge the fact that this event has been totally run and funded by SHPA.

        Dear Keith,


        Thank you for your email 20 September 2017.


        Please be advised that 261 Balwyn Road - North Balwyn is not a new planning application. The original planning application was determined at the direction of VCAT back in January 2015. The current POST application is to extend the time for construction only.


        Please note that there are no minimum lot sizes associated with residential zones in Boroondara. If a dwelling is proposed on a lot under 500 square metres, it triggers the need for a planning permit.



        Kindest regards,


        Lisa Hollingsworth

        Hello Karen,

        Thank you for your email, dated 17 September about the proposed development at the above address.

        Please note that the POST Request you refer to is not a new planning application to develop the site. Planning Alerts is not a Council controlled or sponsored application. It simply draws material from Council's electronic planning register. In this case it has picked up that a request has been lodged to extend the time to begin construction for a development originally approved at the direction of VCAT back in January 2015. The approved development is for thirteen dwellings in a three storey building.

        Yours sincerely,

      submitted, either being deliberate or accidently, within the DA documentation
      as well as submitting my objections to the location of the proposed construction
      of a roller door commercial garbage collection entrance as well as a second
      service entrance at the most southern end of the narrow and dead-end of Jesson
      Lane and directly within the tight turning circle into my garage.\r\n\r\nVehicles,
      such as delivery trucks and vans as well as glass crushers and grease-trap cleaners,
      servicing these two proposed additional Jesson Lane entrances will immediately
      block access to three driveways and as there is no parking or loading provisions
      they will have no option but to park/stop on the road in two NO STOPPING zones.
      Unlike the loading zone parking available in Marlborough Street, there is no
      provision for stopping or parking in this dead-end section of Jesson Lane as
      well as another waste collection and deliveries point being unsustainable for
      Jesson Lane.\r\n\r\nINACCURACY AND INCONSISITENCIES\r\nTRAFFIC by TRAFFIX https://cdn.online.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/dasearch/onexhibition/1316669-8353513.PDF\r\nDESCRIPTION
      OF SURROUNDING ROADS page 4\r\nI would like to bring to your attention page
      four JESSON LANE in the above report. The roadway described as Jesson Lane in
      this report is incorrect and I believe is deliberately misleading so as to give
      the inaccurate impression that Jesson Lane is a wide roadway and not the long
      and narrow laneway it actually is. The description in the report describes the
      much wider Jesson Street and not the narrow Jesson Lane. It sates:\r\n\r\nA
      local road that runs in an east-west direction from Crown Street in the east
      before forming a cul-de-sac in the west. Jesson Lane is subject to a 40km/h
      speed limit in the vicinity of the site and permits traffic flow in both directions.
      Two hour restricted parking (8am-10pm) is available on the southern side of
      Jesson Lane.\r\n\r\nJesson Lane is in fact a long narrow 4.5 metre wide laneway
      running from Jesson Street in the north before forming a non-turning dead-end
      at its southern end. (it does not run east to west) Although it is not a one-direction
      lane, there isn’t enough width for two vehicles travelling in opposite directions
      to pass each other. Therefore when a vehicle enters Jesson Lane and another
      vehicle is leaving Jesson Lane the vehicle entering Jesson Lane must reverse
      completely out of the lane and safely back into Jesson Street so as to allow
      the departing vehicle to pass.\r\n\r\nThere are eight access driveways along
      the eastern side into Jesson Lane from properties facing Crown Street and two
      access driveways at the southern end from properties facing Devonshire Street.
      In between the driveways on the eastern side there is two hour restricted parking
      with NO STOPPING along the entire western side which is also along the rear
      perimeter of 8-12 Marlborough Street. Together with this NO STOPPING zone along
      the western side, directly opposite the proposed new commercial garbage access
      roller door and the second services door there is a driveway and entry into
      a garage and a second NO STOPPING zone along the eastern side. There are also
      another two more driveways directly adjacent to this proposed new waste collection
      roller door and delivery access door. Please see picture in Attachment A\r\n\r\nUnlike
      the deliveries and waste collection to the front of this building from Marlborough
      Street, there is no provision for the delivery vans/trucks, glass crushers and
      grease-trap cleaners to legally park at this end of Jesson Lane so as to make
      deliveries or service the rear of this Marlborough Street building.\r\n \r\nSERVICING
      by TRAFFIX page 8\r\nI would like to bring to your attention that the SERVICING
      report, as below, omits to mention any servicing of waste removal and provision
      for the delivery of goods to the rear of the building from access in the very
      narrow Jesson Lane to the proposed café/restaurant which has been requested
      in this Development Application. It only reports on the more appropriate access
      from Marlborough Street as well as the loading zone parking areas located in
      Marlborough Street which deflects all the attention away from JessonLane waste
      collection and deliveries.\r\n•\tPlease see FORM 2 in the WASTE MANAGEMENT document
      submitted by MASQ Waste Management.\r\n•\tTogether with this please see the
      plans on pages 15-17 in the TRAFFIX report where two large waste removal bins
      sit in a waste alcove behind the new proposed roller door which is adjacent
      to a large goods storage area and both open up onto Jesson Lane. Because the
      floor level is a different at the rear of the building to the front of the building
      they will require servicing from Jesson Lane – not Marlborough Street. Please
      see in the below report, which only mentions WASTE collection and Servicing
      from Marlborough Street, with the Jesson Lane waste collection and servicing
      being omitted from the report although it is included in the plans and a commercial
      garbage access roller door and a services door is requested in this DA.\r\n\r\nGarbage
      collection for the ….?what?? (this word has been either deliberately or accidently
      omitted) will be undertaken from the Marlborough Street kerbside. This arrangement
      reflects the existing method of servicing and is considered acceptable.\r\n\r\nLoading
      for the development is to remain as existing with loading undertaken from the
      loading bay provided along the site frontage on Marlborough Street. Deliveries
      related to the retail and commercial uses are expected to be minimal due to
      the modest size of the tenancy.\r\n\r\nThe loading bay signposted hours of 8am
      to 6pm weekdays and 8am to 12noon Saturday will be sufficient for the predicted
      use and the loading bay size can accommodate up to a B99 van. In this regard,
      the loading zone provided is considered suitable to continue to meet the servicing
      requirements of the site.\r\n \r\nPlease note that there has been a word deliberately
      or accidently omitted from the above SERVICING report ie, collection for the
      ??? will be undertaken from Marlborough Street….with no mention of the Jesson
      Lane garbage facility nor for vehicle deliveries and pick-ups or glass crushing
      and grease-trap cleaning. Likewise the above underlined sentence referring to
      the modest size of the tenancy for the retail and commercial uses does not mention
      Jesson Lane as a SERVICING site for this tenancy. Attention is totally focused
      on Marlborough Street, to which I have no objection at all. What I object to
      is the commercial garbage bins that will be left on the street right in the
      turning circle into my garage and blocking entrance into my and another two
      other car spaces as well as the service vehicles illegally parking on the road
      in a NO STOPPING zone and again blocking entrance into my car space and the
      other two car spaces as shown in Attachment A.\r\n\r\nThe entire western side
      of Jesson Lane, which borders the Marlborough Street property, is a NO STOPPING
      zone so as not to obstruct access into driveways of the properties on the eastern
      side.\r\n\r\nCommercial garbage collection and regular daily servicing for a
      retail outlet at this Jesson Ln proposed location, is extremely inappropriate
      for Jesson Ln, as Jesson Ln is too narrow, there is no parking this end and
      as both sides of this section of the lane are a NO STOPPING area. Traffic and
      commercial bins will directly obstruct access to three driveways and the noise
      generated daily by garbage trucks will adversely affect 11 residential properties
      in direct and close vicinity to the proposed waste and services area.\r\n\r\nI
      bring your attention to Council’s WASTE POLICY (October 2013) Page 19 \r\n…
      bins must not impede vehicle access to neigbouring premises…..\r\nPlease see
      pictures taken in Jesson Lane last week on the evening of 6 and 8 September
      showing how commercial bins and bags of rubbish are left for collection on the
      road. (see Attachment B) Approving another commercial bin collection site, especially
      on the opposite side of Jesson Lane, will exacerbate an already out of control
      situation where there is little existing infrastructure for waste collection
      and deliveries to the current cafes. Because council’s regulations are virtually
      impossible to enforce approving this will further fan an already hostile situation
      between commercial outlets and residents.\r\n\r\nAt 4.5 meters wide, Jesson
      Lane is a very narrow one lane access road. Allowing a minimum of 2.2 meters
      for cars parked along the eastern side there is little room left for large trucks
      and vans to negotiate the long laneway required to reach their destination.
      Compounding this issue is the fact that there is NO TURNING CIRCLE at the end
      of the lane where the proposed new roller door entrance and service doors are
      planned. This means that all vehicles, large and small, having driven in, need
      to then either reverse all the way back along the long narrow lane to get out
      or vice-a-versa and that is, to reverse into and all along to the end of the
      long narrow lane and then drive out when leaving. This will need to happen for
      all deliveries and waste removal which will be on going each and every day.
      This becomes even more hazardous when a second vehicle enters the lane and needs
      to access one of the properties. During the day traffic becomes chaotic and
      is a major safety hazard. Adding to this dangerous practice is the fact that
      once the delivery destination has been reached there is absolutely nowhere to
      legally park or stop. At times it all becomes quite chaotic.\r\n\r\nTRAFFIX
      report – ATTACHMENTS pages 15 & 17\r\nDrawings\r\nThe Traffix Report Attachments
      2 & 3 in this DA both clearly illustrate that there are two large commercial
      garbage bins behind a wide roller door as well as a service door both opening
      onto Jesson Lane. The servicing of this facility has been omitted in all the
      submitted reports by TRAFFIX.\r\n\r\nAlso the building diagram has been cropped
      so that the three driveways directly affected, that is, the one opposite and
      the two adjacent driveways, are not included in the drawings. Also there is
      no mention that this section of Jesson Lane is a NO STOPPING zone on both sides
      of the lane.\r\n\r\nCommercial garbage collection and regular daily servicing
      from at this end of Jesson Lane is extremely inappropriate, (unlike from Marlborough
      Street which has been thoroughly covered in all the reports for this DA).\r\n\r\nBecause
      Jesson Lane is so narrow and because there is no legal parking/stopping at this
      end of the lane, as both sides of lane are a NO STOPPING area, a service and
      garbage area at this end of the building, will directly obstruct access to three
      driveways and the noise generated will adversely affect 11 residential properties
      in direct and close vicinity to the proposed waste and services area.\r\n\r\nLike
      other commercial bin collections, the bins are taken out of their storage area
      for collection and are often not brought back in but remain on the road indefinitely.
      Although this is contrary to council’s regulations and it is also contrary to
      council’s policy of, bins’ must not impede vehicle access to neigbouring properties,
      all the commercial bins left on the road in this instance will most definitely
      impede access to three neighbouring driveways.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOver the past
      years, please refer to council records correspondence/emails between myself
      and council as well as the Lord Mayor Clover Moore as far back as 2010, (Attachment
      C), there have been continual complaints to council about commercial garbage
      bins and other refuse left on the road in Jesson Lane 24/7. Unlike in this application,
      the rear of the cafés back onto the eastern side of the Jesson Lane, not the
      western, however until 2015, these commercial bins were being stored on the
      western footpath alongside this current development site, as what is proposed
      in this DA. In 2015 this practice reached a crisis level, and eventually council
      forced the Crown Street cafes to remove all the bins being stored on the western
      side footpath and move them into their own driveways at the rear of their own
      properties on the eastern side thus clearing all commercial bins from being
      stored on the footpath along the western side of Jesson Lane. Ideally they should
      be stored inside on their own property and not left on public property but I
      have been told that this cannot be enforced by council. The removal of the commercial
      bins from the western footpath also allowed a clearer traffic flow along Jesson
      Lane without vehicles having to stop to pick up boxes and other refuse that
      has fallen from the footpath onto the road before being able to proceed.\r\n\r\nPlease
      see pictures sent to council taken in 2015 of what the western footpath looked
      like in 2015, Attachment D.\r\n\r\nThese commercial garbage bins and their associated
      refuse were not only an eyesore and health hazard as well as attracting rats
      and other vermin, but also obstructed traffic driving along the narrow laneway.
      Please note that although the wheels of very large commercial bins, (as seen
      in the TRAFFIX Report picture on page 13), just fit onto the footpath, the bins
      are wider at the top than the bottom and the perimeter of the top of the bin
      actually overhangs the footpath over the road which obstructs the road having
      caused cars to sideswipe the bins, especially if they do not fold-in their reversing
      mirrors. Must we need to do this every time we drive along Jesson Lane?\r\n\r\nTogether
      with my correspondence with council in February/March 2010, and again with Kenneth
      Wagstaff in June 2015, I refer you to correspondence during April and May 2017
      between myself and council regarding the consistent illegal serial parking/stopping
      in No Stopping areas and the blocking of the entrance to Jesson Lane by delivery
      vans and trucks servicing the Crown Street cafes and boutiques which back onto
      Jesson Lane. Please see letter from Lord Mayor, Clover Moore, (Attachment E)
      Also please refer to council record emails between myself and Eoin Cunningham
      and Lara Davies, (if required I have copies). Also please see Attachment F,
      which is a schedule of the Jesson Lane traffic violations all occurring during
      the one day on 20 January 2017.\r\n\r\nTo further illustrate the current traffic
      chaos and traffic violations in Jesson Lane, please see the 52 minute film clip,
      (sent to the Mayor and the council), filmed on Friday 20 January 2017 which
      documents illegal parking and general road chaos from illegal parking and stopping
      during one day by delivery vans/trucks and other services;\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ9v_kD2KuQ\r\n\r\nCouncil
      approving another two service accesses on the opposite side of all the current
      driveways in Jesson Lane will further escalate an already unsustainable and
      hostile situation. Unfortunately patrolling the NO STOPPING zones is difficult
      and each day the perpetrators escape without penalties at the detriment, inconvenience,
      and annoyance, of local residents’ by serial blocking of vehicle access to our
      own properties.\r\n\r\nPlease do not approve more commercial waste collection
      and servicing facilities in Jesson Lane, especially along the western side and
      especially as Marlborough Street has been and still is an ideal access point
      for the retail/cafe component of this DA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOISE EMMISSION ASSESMENT
      report by Acoustic Logic\r\nPlease note ITEM 2, page 5 states:\r\n\r\nNearest
      residential receivers are located to the east of the development, across Jesson
      Lane, approximately 8 metres from the site boundary.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect
      as there is also a row of seven residential terraces to the south facing Devonshire
      Street, these are 252, 254, 256, 258, 260, 262 & 264 that are in direct vicinity
      to the development. Residents from 256 and 258 can hear the live theatrical
      rehearsals taking place on the first floor of this non soundproof Marlborough
      Street Warehouse.\r\n\r\nIn this instance the issue with the noise is not to
      a great extent the ‘level’ of noise but what the noise is, and that is real
      people screaming and shouting loudly at each other most days of the week. This
      has not been included in this NOISE EMMISSION ASSESMENT Unlike a loud jack hammer,
      or even a siren, it has been proven that hearing this type of repeated ‘human’
      shouting and screaming evokes a ‘flight or fight’ response which releases adrenalin
      which is responsible for causing an"

      and visitors to the area to shop. We oppose constructions that are new and at
      odds to the atmosphere created here. If you want new, go shop at Docklands.
      This is the quality lifestyle that Clifton Hill has nourished. I live a few
      kilometres away, yet walk here every week to shop. More expensive, sure but
      the proprietors are friendly, knowledgeable and as close to a country feel as
      I can get. Everywhere else within cooee of me is being destroyed by high density
      living. Try walking down Nicholson Street without feeling the chill that obliterating
      the sun has now provided. It needs to stop here.\r\nAnd there is a heritage
      overlay in here. And parking is a nightmare already! Say no to anymore medium
      to high density new builds."

    text: "It's disappointing to note that LMCC has approved another DA at 55 Caves
      Beach Road, Caves Beach allowing one lot to be amended to 30 lots for strata
      units without any community consultation and adding to the excessive amount
      of dwellings to be built on this site, being in excess of 200, whilst at the
      same time stating there will be no environmental impact on the area. \r\n\r\nWhat
      about the increased amount of people and traffic to the area, the drain on water
      and sewerage services and the loss of enjoyment of our peaceful beach side suburb
      for current residents?\r\n\r\nNo doubt this is a windfall for the council when
      they collect all the extra rates from these new residences, one can only hope
      that they consider reducing rates for us all in light of this policy that is
      approving medium/high density DAs throughout LMCC area. \r\n\r\nBring on the
      next council election I say and anyone running who is against further development
      will definitely get my vote   \r\n\r\n  "

        G'day Carolyn,



        Thank you for your comments and I will make sure any assessment of the development application takes them into full consideration.



        This development application will undergo full assessment by Council before any decision is made.  I have already spoken to staff about this site and will be fully briefed of progress and possible outcomes.



        I would like to point out that this is privately owned land not public open space.  On the issue on Council's commitment to both koalas and wildlife, there is approximately $5.6 million in the current financial year budget to be spent on environmental issues including monitoring and tagging of the koala population on the former Petrie Paper Mill site where the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) will be building its new campus.  Just this morning I visited a site in Warner (John H Walker Reserve) where 6100 trees are being planted today.  Approximately 50% of these trees are koala habitat trees.



        I am more than happy to have a personal discussion with you about Council's approach to environmental issues if you so desire.  Please contact my office on 3480 6869 if you wish to make a time to catch up.


        Kind Regards,
        God Bless,
        Mike.

      The proposal is contrary to the design objectives contained in State Panning
      Framework Clause 15.01 – 1 Urban Design as the scale, massing, design and architectural
      expression of the proposed building is not appropriate to the features of the
      site and surrounds and therefore the development will not contribute to a safe,
      functional and good quality environment.\r\n\r\n3. The height, scale, massing
      and design detail of the development will result is a building which will dominate
      the surrounding streetscapes and is not in keeping the character of the area
      and fails to comply the objectives 22.17 and clause 43.02.\r\n\r\n4. The proposal
      is contrary to Clause 43.02 Schedule 29 (Design and Development Overlay 29)
      of the Melbourne panning Scheme in that the development does not respect the

        Scott ,

        Very simple they push the barriers to gain more. They provide voluntary planning agreements to council to gain extra GREED. These VPA's are not satisfactory as they provide no benefit to the community only impact our local streets with parking issues - no open  space and more traffic.

        I am very aware of the issues people are raising as a born and raised resident in Ryde. I have seen the sudden change. I suggest you visit Meadowbank and see overdevelopment at it's best.

        Thanks Scott,

        I was at the Tennyson Rd action group this afternoon objecting to the proposal in Tennyson Rd and discussing the impacts to the locals, it's a serious issue now in Gladesville and all of NSW.

        The developers have other avenues of approval which needs policing.I am more than satisfied to be of assistance please feel free to call me.

      is council asking the developer whether they think the public notification period
      should recommence. Isnt this up to the council to direct him to do this due
      to the confusion with the current application. I simply expect the applicant
      to say no.  If this is the case does this give residents a legal stance on incorrect
      and misleading Public Notification?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The applicant has advised
      that he is seeking approval on the new ultimate layout (refer info request response)
      however the fact that applicant has notified the public on a different superseded
      layout  needs to be addressed.  It has also become evident that  the supporting
      technical reports haven’t been updated appropriately and still contain simple
      errors that makes the submission in its current form significantly underdone
      and  not suitable for public comment. This is a very simple and significant
      error that the letter response seems to have passed over and legal comment on
      the validity of the DA as it stand should be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe issue of
      the DA having two different layouts and conflicting supporting technical documents
      needs to be addressed. The rules for DA application states that what is being
      applied for needs to be clear and concise and that any different layout needs
      to form part of a different DA. \r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that a DA can
      only have one proposed arrangement and a different layout needs a different
      submission. Refer DA Assessment Rules - Planning Act 2016.  The variation in
      the proposed arrangements, access and layout indicates that according to Schedule
      1 of the Planning Act 2016 that this is a \"Substantially different development\"
      due to the following:\r\n\r\n(c) changes the built form in terms of scale, bulk
      and appearance\r\n(d) changes the ability of the site to operate as intended\r\n€
      \ removes a component that is critical to the operation (i.e. access)\r\n(f)
      significantly impacts traffic\r\n(g) introduces new impacts or increases severity
      of known impacts\r\n\r\nAs a result we feel that the applicant is trying to
      push 2 layouts as part of this single DA that are both significantly different....\r\n\r\nTelling
      the community to make comment on both layouts isnt a really viable option as
      we are not expected to have to do this as part of the Planning Act (Do we get
      15 days each to comment on 2 layouts - total 30 days - I think not) . As an
      unbiased council ‪the residents‬ should be getting as much consideration as
      the developer who has time and time again made this entire process very difficult
      but has seemed to have the council accept time and time again the unrealistic
      delays and significantly poor standards of submission.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. The community
      is requesting that legal review of this DA in this inappropriate form is sought
      as it is a very simple issue. The technical and supporting documents do not
      reflect the layout being sought by the applicant and have significant errors
      and assumptions that cant be supported. The council needs to step up and agree
      that residents are not being given information to a level to allow for accurate
      public notification. \r\n\r\n4. There is significant reason to go back again
      with further information requests and to not accept the DA in its current form.
      Can council please undertake legal review to identify at what point a rejection
      of this DA would then absolve them from any compensation claim.  I am sure there
      is a point where council accepts that legally it has an argument to support
      not having to make compensation as the DA was not to a suitable standard for
      public comment in the timeframes given.\r\n\r\nThe issue as we see it still
      remains significantly unresolved and continues to make the process of public
      consultation a complete farce at this moment in time.  \r\n\r\nAs expected we
      are becoming increasingly frustrated that these matters cant be resolved in
      a timely manner when such strict time periods for our objections are imposed.
      \r\n\r\nI do however understand that it gives the community more ammunition
      for an appeal in future. The community is asking council to reject this application
      for the reasons stated above. \r\nA timely legal response from council would
      be appreciated that actually deals with the easily understood issue at hand.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nSave

      have been supporting residents managing and protecting the conservation values
      of their properties. Over 600 properties are already registered with council’s

      needs to ensure the site landscape plan enhances ecological and cultural site
      values and reduces the building footprint.\r\n\r\nTo enhance ecological and

      Environmental Assessment Report to be undertaken prior to development approval\r\n\r\n2.

      so.\r\n\r\nOur property is at the rear of the proposed development and I have
      a number of very serious concerns. These include the issue of stormwater run
      off through 1-3 Marcel Ave and the damage to our property and flooding that
      would occur.\r\n\r\nThe breach of planning rules regarding the height of the
      proposal will restrict light into our property and also inflict a lack of privacy.
      \r\n\r\nThere is also the noise issue with the building pushed back and very
      close to our property we will lose amenity we now enjoy.\r\n\r\nI hope you can

      of Marcel avenue and indeed the residence of Clovelly. This proposed development
      is way out of line with the current streetscape. Marcel Avenue is already a
      very narrow street, the addition of more cars and more residents to an already
      over crowded street will create congestion and extra traffic that the street
      really can not deal with. Not to mention that the proposed development will
      tower above the federation style houses next to it. There is already high density
      housing on the opposite side of the street and the current row of federation
      houses on this side offers relief to this high density. Why does Sydney insist
      on knocking down anything with character and beauty only to build large ugly
      buildings.\r\nI hope Randwick council will help to preserve this suburbs history
      rather than destroy it."

        Hi Catherine
        Thank you for contacting me regarding this Development Application DA/459/2017 for 1-3 Marcel Avenue<x-apple-data-detectors://0>.
        Please note at this early stage in the process, without an assessment report having been finalised by the assessment officer, I am unable to form any views on the merits/or likewise of the proposal. However, the matter will be coming to Council and when it is on the Business Paper please contact me again.
        Kind regards

        Clr Kathy Neilson
        Randwick City Council

        I very much hope that Randwick council will do the right thing by the residents of Marcel avenue and indeed the residence of Clovelly. This proposed development is way out of line with the current streetscape. Marcel Avenue is already a very narrow street, the addition of more cars and more residents to an already over crowded street will create congestion and extra traffic that the street really can not deal with. Not to mention that the proposed development will tower above the federation style houses next to it. There is already high density housing on the opposite side of the street and the current row of federation houses on this side offers relief to this high density. Why does Sydney insist on knocking down anything with character and beauty only to build large ugly buildings.
        I hope Randwick council will help to preserve this suburbs history rather than destroy it.

    text: "Hello Kiel and all Randwick councillors, I would like to re-iterate the
      comments of Andrew. I am a resident of Marcel Ave and have been so for over
      20 years. This proposal is a massive overdevelopment of the site and will be
      a huge blight on Marcel Ave. Besides all the breaches of the LEP (and there
      are numerous) this large bulky building will seriously impact the outlook of
      the neighbours, neighbourhood and dominate the space of the surrounding area.
      At a height of 12 metres, a flat roof, square shaped building, it will be an
      eyesore and by no means lies within the character of the street (but it is actually
      an avenue and therefore this sort of development should never be allowed). Number
      3 Marcel Ave has a height restriction of 9 metres so how can this be achieved
      if the flat roof is not stepped down from the boundary between 1 and 3? The
      12 metre height appears to be maintained across the entire frontage. The different
      lots should be treated separately at least.\r\nThe eastern end of Marcel Ave,
      including Moira Cres, is a Heritage Conservation Area (HCA) with Bungalow style
      buildings. This development should fall into this style of building with terracotta
      tiles on pitched roofs. The height of the building should be restricted to the
      same as per the other houses on this side of the street. It is beyond my comprehension
      how the current R3 zoning for 1-3 Marcel Ave was ever approved. It should be
      changed or restricted in some way.\r\nMarcel Ave is a narrow street, especially
      at the eastern end. As noted above, I have been a resident of this street for
      over 20 years and observed continual increase in traffic and reduced parking
      over this time. The street is now a hazard for the many children who do live
      in the street. The street had a real family feel about it for many years but
      this has slowly eroded as more and more traffic traverse the street and cars
      look for parking from neighbouring streets, especially Carrington Rd, which
      has been the subject of continual unit block development. Many of these residents
      have to find parking in Marcel Ave so you can’t blame them. Add a unit block
      of this size and parking will be more of a nightmare. Additional traffic and
      the congestion will pose will be a risk to children playing in the street and
      as parents we want them to have the opportunity to run around outside not restricted
      to indoors, stuck on PlayStation and Xbox’s.\r\nI and many other residents of
      Marcel Ave and the neighbouring streets would like to this development brought
      back in line with the current character and look of the street. Not a massive
      unit block that will have ongoing impacts. We want to make a stand and do hope
      you will support us on this.\r\nRegards\r\nSteve \r\n"

        Thank you for your email. I note your concerns. Council is currently assessing this development application in accordance with its obligations under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. The assessment will look at performance of the development against the relevant planning instruments including the Randwick Local Environment Plan and the Randwick Development Control Plan. Also considered will the the submissions from surrounding residents. At the completion an assessment report will be prepared. If you contact the Councillors they can request to see this report before approval or refusal is determined. The Councillors can call the DA before a full meeting of the Council for determination if they do not believe the report adequately considers your concerns.

        As I am not standing for re-election at the imminent September 9 elections I will no longer be a Councillor when this report is finalised. Can I therefore recommend you make sure that my successor is made aware of your objections post the election.

      type of ridiculous overdevelopment. This DA is in breach of limitations set
      in the LEP it is well over the height and over the FSR the floor ratio. \r\nThe
      development is completely out of character in close proximity to a conservation
      area. \r\nIf anyone knows Marcel Ave this road has become almost a one way street
      with daily near car collisions causing hazards to drivers there is no parking
      left, due to the ongoing apartments being built in close by Carrington Rd. This
      Ave is already at full capacity and this type of high density development including
      a 4 storey building in a beautiful area such as Marcel Ave will change the face
      of Randwick forever.\r\nThere are no other buildings like this on the same side
      of the road all buildings are in keeping with the conservation area at the other
      end. The residents in the area are strongly opposed to such a gross proposal
      that is lacking in design and not in keeping with the neighbouring Classic Californian
      bungalows. \r\nThere is also serious concern with the stormwater which has not
      been accounted for when there is flash flooding from Clovelly Rd after heavy
      rainfall that floods between No 1 and 3 Marcel Ave. \r\nNot to mention the loss
      of privacy, loss of sunlight that all bordering properties both on Marcel and
      Carrington Rd will be immediately affected by in negative way. \r\nBoth numbers
      1 and 3 Marcel Ave have different heights and floor ratios therefore should
      be treated as two seperate developments and not combined as one large overdevelopment.
      The LEP has not been adhered to or respected in this application. "

        and it needs upgrading in some way. Violet Town Rd is also used as a race
        track and burn out zone right in front of where the entrance to the development
        is going, have a look for yourselves at the tire marks on the road there.
        The traffic assessment report does not take into account that south bound
        traffic will use Camberwarra Drive shortcut to Floraville Rd. not the roundabout
        intersection with Violet Town Rd. causing a major traffic problem in the backstreets.\nI
        am sure many more objections would have been submitted if people knew about
        the Development application, but as only adjoining neighbours were notified
        and the fact that no visible sign was put on the property many residents will
        be shocked if it does go ahead. I wouldn't send my child there.\n\n\nFrom

        Hello Joy,

        I have requested information from Council officers about this.

        They advise that there is no new application for this site. They were undertaking some testing of Council systems using a simulated application and unfortunately Planning Alerts picked this up.

        I am very sorry about this and about any inconvenience it may have caused you.

        Regards,

      The rubbish collection truck has GREAT issues trying to turn around in the SMALL

        Dear Genevieve

        I have been advised that "The subject site is located in the Low-medium Density Residential Zone under the planning scheme and therefore the level of assessment is code assessment (and will not require public notification).  Notwithstanding, any concerns residents are still able to make written representations to Council for its consideration in determining the application."

        Whilst I have forwarded your email to planning staff, I would encourage you and others in Strong Street to write to Council outlining all the issues which this proposed development would bring to your street.  I have expressed my concern to staff and the planning Councillors - Cr Tait and Cr Glasheen - as I feel it isn't the right fit for Strong Street. I am also aware Council is requesting additional information in relation to concerns around parking, street access.

        Please get your street engaged in this process to ensure you are all heard.

        Regards
        Nancy

    text: "Ian Lake commented less than a minute ago\r\nThe Hamlet of Lalla comprises
      18 dwellings located in an area adjacent to the proposed \r\nDevelopment. I
      am the owner of 361 Lalla Road. \r\nI have a number of objections to the proposal.
      \r\nFirstly the application approval for the first initial laying shed is seriously
      flawed in its environmental assessment and by implication so is the current
      application. \r\n- Odour assessment and wind vectors. Earlier this year the
      applicant spread large quantities of chicken manure on land owned by the applicant
      close to next to housing in the Karoola hamlet. The resulting strong foul odour
      could be smelt from Karoola and along Lalla road. This strong odour affected
      many dwellings and owners myself included. The duration of the odour was some
      weeks. \r\n- pollution of waterways with high nutrient levels. The applicant
      spread a large amount of chicken manure within 3 meters of a permanent watercourse.
      This water course runs adjacent to the first layer shed and directly into the
      Pipers river in close proximity. \r\nRunoff from the above practice would have
      resulted in pollutant of the Pipers River with excessive nutrients. Photographic
      evidence can be provided of the locality and extent. \r\n- The Karoola and Lalla
      hamlets are situated in a scenic protection area. \r\nThe construction of large
      layer sheds in highly reflective zincalume detracts significantly from the visual
      beauty of the area. \r\n- The locality of Lalla Road has a number of planning
      permits for tourism and accommodation. The Pear Walk bed and breakfast , The
      Apple shed Gallery, Lalla road Vineyard and Cellar door , and the Wag Walker
      rhododendron gardens visitor centre. \r\nAll of these businesses are to be affected
      by this intensive animal husbandry located in the immediate vicinity. They will
      be affected by strong odours, by large sheds impairing the scenic beauty of
      the area, and damage to the envirionment. \r\nIn Summary I am in support the
      council's rural resource zone and its continuation. \r\nI am not in support
      of the impact of intensive industrial farming, and in particular the poor track
      record of the applicants first layer shed has had on denigrating the local amenity,
      and the further negative impacts the applicants current proposal will have on
      \r\nthe many residences and tourism businesses in the locality.\r\ndelivered

    text: "I object to this development in this residential area. It is in consistent
      with the area, zoning. it promotes a transient resident in an area obviously
      meant for long term residents. There is insufficient facilities for so many
      new people in one location eg: parking. Where would they park any cars they
      have? Maybe line 24 of them up along Ray Rd? Sufficient public transport is
      also a concern for this location. With transient residents who will look after
      the property ?  as this is accommodation for a maximum of 3 mths per person
      you will have constant moving in and out of people in an area that is clearly
      not designed for it. \r\nI object to this development in this location. "

    text: "\r\nWe will be lodging an official objection to this application. I have
      been writing to council already for years about inadequate street parking outside
      20, 22, 29 and 31 Pemberton street for residence as a result of the 3 row dwellings
      at no. 20 Pemberton Street and the dangerous conditions for us exiting and entering
      our driveway because of vehicles parked opposite our driveway in this narrow
      street and vehicles parked on both sides of the road. And council approving
      the 3 row dwellings at no. 20 with garages too narrow for vehicles to park in
      forcing vehicles on the street. Therefore I am objecting to 3 further row dwellings
      right next to the 3 row dwellings you have already approved at no.20 that have
      been built and are creating traffic hazards from inadequate street parking.\r\n"

    text: "The council has approved so many boarding houses in kingsford & randwick
      that it has changed the look and feel of the suburb into a family oriented to
      student disorientated area. A three(3) storey high boarding house visually looks
      out of character beside the more common one(1) to two (2) storey houses in the
      suburb. Not to mention the reduced natural sun in the neighbouring footpath
      and roads.\r\n\r\nSince the increased approval of boarding houses, I have observed
      more illegal  dumping of furniture and competition for street parking space.
      In these particular areas of students as the main clientele, they are short
      term residents and do not care about the look and feel of the suburbs. This
      adds to the council costs to clean up and ultimately passed onto the residents
      to pay for cleaning up of others inconsiderate dumping of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe
      council and state planning laws have only addressed the issue of shortage of
      housing accommodation, but has typically not planned for additional vehicles
      & residents requiring additional parking, and public transportation infrastructure.
      How is it possible you approve a house with 15 plus bedrooms that does not require
      for onsite parking within the house or land? If these tenants can pay $400-$450
      per week in rent, what makes you think they can't purchase a cheap vehicle and
      leave outside street parking. I'm fed up looking for street parking when I use
      my work vehicle and also sick and tired of people parking in front of my driveway
      constantly especially on Friday, Saturday nights when going for dinner all due
      to your lack of planning and lack of requirement for the builder to provide
      onsite parking. No matter how many times I have placed signs and called the
      council. Sometimes I can get negative objections from these drivers. There have
      also been several abandoned vehicles left for months before being reported and
      legally towed away.\r\n\r\nThis development can negatively impact the value
      of the properties in the area if more boarding houses are approved. Ultimately
      if the council approves more of these houses, it will change the pleasant family
      suburb to a visually unpleasant suburb of disproportionate  housing level and
      architecture and more rubbish and less parking."

        a quick look at the plans on this application but I note that there is mention
        of open space (urban parklets etc). I'd be keen to hear your thoughts on what

      How it is allowed to be demolished as soon as next month is beyond me. If it
      was known to everyone who lives and visits Mornington I’m sure there would be
      more of a protest but, it appears there is no notice posted for public awareness.\r\nGiven

    text: "Hi - Question regarding the zoning and overlays to this site:  Is there
      a neighbourhood character restriction to this site and its surrounds?  This
      has been applied by council locally to other nearby streets - which are now
      blocked from carrying out a development of this kind on a site this size.\r\n\r\nOn
      another note, I am greatly troubled by the potential loss of this home from
      the area.  It is a fabulous example of the period architecture which made this
      area of Mornington what it is today.  The difference between conservation and
      restriction on development should not hinder natural improvement and modernising
      of the area - I am a building designer.  There are ways to achieve both.  My
      understanding of what the neighbourhood's environment and integrity seems to
      differ however from that of the council and the planning implementations.\r\n\r\nI
      look forward to your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCiaran Wilcox\r\n0415

      realistically the highest development in our local area should be two floors

      St.Bronte is appalling.And it just shows what can happen to our heritage with
      the recent legislation passed by the State government. This situation begs the
      question as to why these charming houses have not been heritage listed and how
      much more will we lose before the government & the Council put greater support
      behind our heritage ? If houses over 100 years old can be removed without proper
      consideration what else could our suburbs lose ?

      their cars to the racetracks with all the police attention as of late. As a
      result you will find an increase in illegal hooning behaviour done on public
      roads. By providing a legal outlet to obtain their enjoyment, you are benefiting

      This is important for unloading children and groceries, and especially necessary

    text: "\r\n\r\nPemberton Street is already short on street parking in this area
      of development. Cars are parked continuously on both sides of the road reducing
      it to one narrow road which is dangerous. The street is already very high in
      traffic for a residential area as the street is used by vehicles travelling
      from Marion shops/ Oaklands Road to Marion Road. We have no visitor or resident
      street parking area for 29, 29A, 31 Pemberton street as these are used by the
      3 row dwelling development houses you already approved at no 21 and did not
      consider development objections about insufficient parking then. Leaving NO
      street carparks for a 3 and 4 bedroom residence opposite. Vehicles are already
      taking up the street parking outside 35 and 37 Pemberton Street forcing vehicles
      to drive over concrete chevrons in the centre of the road to avoid parked cars
      on the both sides of the street which is dangerous. The 3 row dwellings at 21,
      21A and 21B  have garages so narrow that a sedan is too wide to get through
      the door and if a smaller car fits in there is no room to get out of the vehicle.
      The garages are therefore useless and force residence to park on the street
      taking all available carparks for 5 houses!!I am objecting to another 3 houses
      being built on 1 block in this street for these above reasons. It is zoned low
      to medium density but you are packing so many houses into this area with your
      development approvals that you are creating dangerous traffic conditions and
      you are taking away peoples enjoyment of living in this area and leaving houses
      with NO street parking at all!! No 19 and 21, 21A and 21B residence also already
      have issues with no street parking spaces being available and park in our spaces
      on our side of the street leaving us with no street parking. You will be creating
      more problems for residence in this street to approve another 3 houses on the
      one block. There will be no space for bins in most of the street on rubbish
      collection day. My bin has not been collected previously because of parked cars.
      Marion shop carparking overflow fills our street bumper to bumper cars at peak
      times of the year on both sides of the road and I have almost been hit twice
      on the road on my pushbike because of this. I have photographs of the parking
      issues and of cars wider then garage entrances in this street. The council do
      not take into account the existing parking problems and keep approving these
      developments. When writing to council about the existing parking issues they
      do nothing about it but make it worse by approving these overcrowded row dwelling
      developments. \r\n"

        Hello Clare

        I refer to your email via Planning Alerts regarding the property at the above address.

        Please be advised that Council refused a planning application to develop the site for a four storey building comprising restaurants and apartments in February 2014. The application attracted over 700 objections. One of the major concerns raised by Council and the objectors related to the impact on car parking in the area. The applicant appealed this decision to VCAT and following a seven day hearing which involved expert evidence being called by Council, the objectors and the applicant, a decision was made by VCAT to allow the appeal, based on plans for a three storey building. Although Council was not happy with the result, it was at least a better outcome than had been initially proposed.

        The latest post in Planning Alerts simply notes the submission of an environmental audit for the site, which was required by a condition of the permit, rather than being a new application. Unfortunately Planning Alerts picks up everything recorded in Council's planning register, including information required post the issue of a permit, rather than just new applications.

    text: "I wish to submit my concern that this proposed development of a 2-storey
      house (plus basement) plus a separate granny flat appears to be way over-sized
      for this very small subdivided remaining vacant lot of only 362.6 sq m!\r\nIsn't
      the minimum permitted lot size for a dwelling house & granny flat 450 sq metres?
      \r\n\r\nThe 1st floor setbacks are also non-complying being only about half
      of the HDCP 8metre requirement! \r\nThe sloping roof eaves appear wider still,
      like sails,over-powering, only adding to the over-sized crammed look for this
      tiny lot!\r\n\r\nShadow diagrams do not seem to fully indicate how neighboring
      properties would be fully affected by shade.\r\n\r\nSurely a small house with
      trees/landscaping would be more visually appealing & fit in more appropriately
      within the current home streetscape on this side of Lovett Street.\r\n\r\nProviding
      affordable housing is great, but not at the expense of cramming in granny flats
      'willy-nilly' on tiny sub-divided blocks - hence all the newly-zoned unit blocks
      currently being built in Thornleigh!\r\n\r\nI submit this DA be rejected by
      Council on these grounds.\r\n\r\nAlso, I cannot see on Council's site online,

    text: 'I''m not sure of the historic relevance of this particular building as
      it is difficult to see what it comprises beyond the high external fence, but
      obviously it''s age and character dictates that it should not be consigned to
      the scrapheap of history. If we don''t value our heritage and past, what do
      we value? The surrounding streets have a number of beautiful mature trees that
      I suspect would have been part of this original property and planted by the
      early owners, conifers, redwoods (sequoias I think!) etc. The planning of the
      surrounding area has been pretty poor to date. I hope they don''t compound this
      with another bad decision.     '

      Street, Waverley. 28 Barclay Street immediately adjoins 30 Barclay Street to
      the north.I am writing to outline my concern in response to the recent application
      to get illegal building works approved retrospectively on the adjoining property
      (30 Barclay Street), by way of s96 application DA-630/2014-C. \r\nThere is an
      existing 1.8m dividing fence between 28 and 30 Barclay Street. A new fence has
      been constructed immediately abutting the existing dividing fence that extends
      3m+above the ground level of our property. \r\nMr Warren Banfield of Council
      has had direct discussions with foreman for the works at 30 Barclay Street on
      6 June 2017. I have an email from Mr Banfield that records these discussions.
      In addition to confirming that the level of the swimming pool is higher than
      approved, the foreman confirmed that a section 96 modification application would
      be submitted to Council in relation to the illegal works. \r\nCouncil should
      not condone such a wilful abuse of the planning process and should not exercise
      its discretion in favour of the builder and owner of 30 Barclay Street. I submit
      that Council should exercise its discretion in favour ofthe existing residents/ratepayers
      who are innocent parties to this illegal building activity, which now directly
      impacts our amenity, privacy, and sunlight to our property."

    text: "Hi Richard\r\n\r\nWe have been to VCAT in April over this development at
      1 Dargie Place and I have spoken to you personally about the residents concerns
      re the over-development of this block. At VCAT the developer and owner said
      they were going to start construction immediately and now its July and nothing
      has happened at all. We are very concerned they are attempting to make changes
      without the residents knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt VCAT it was noted that the behaviour
      of the developers was unprofessional and that they had not submitted a landscape
      plan for the site. As this development is convening the streetscape of this
      beautiful court it is imperative that the council and residents ensure that
      all issues raised in VCAT have been addressed. \r\n\r\nOf particular concern
      is the notation on the website that  no date was recorded by council.\r\n\r\n\"We
      found this application for you on the planning authority's website 3 days ago.
      The date it was received by them was not recorded.\"\r\n\r\nThe dealings with
      this development so far has been extremely concerning with several breaches
      of OHS laws, unsafe work practices, leaving the site un-fenced next to a play-ground,
      workers urinating and defecating on the block in full view of the public and
      Worksafe had to be called in as the council refused to take any action. \r\n\r\nCould
      you please give this your urgent attention so the residents of Dargie Place
      and surrounding area can have confidence that the council is showing due diligence
      of this development. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nChris Peterson\r\n2 Dargie Place\r\n\r\n"

      to be a an increasing trend, especially in the last 6 months or so. Has Council
      changed its policy on tree protection? Anecdotally, I have heard of perfectly
      healthy native specimens that have had their removal recently approved. This
      is after many years of refusal by council for the same tree. I have recently
      seen an application for the removal of 15 trees from one site! Replacement by
      a healthy tree of a certain size is often a condition of approval by council
      but who polices this requirement? Again anecdotally, I am aware of three separate
      instances where this condition has never been met. The owner didn''t want a
      tree there, for whatever reason, why would they plant another one? And if no
      one is going to enforce the requirement, mission accomplished. '

      We are hearing increasing amounts of discontent and anger over the impending
      development of the War Memorial Hopsital site on Birrell,Church and Carrington
      Roads. Part of the major development (along with building 5 storey buildings
      and 250+ underground car parks...) is the removal of historical, beautiful trees
      and their magnificent canopies full of  vast wildlife....these trees are 80+
      years old and as we understood...protected. No so protected now it seems. Will
      Waverley Council and the Community stand for this. ..? The Local Community and
      Schools etc are now getting very upset about this destruction of beautiful flora
      and accomopanying fauna. Spread the word, this must stop...!

        Deputy Lord Mayor of Sydney, Professor Kerryn Phelps AM, would like to thank you for taking the time to email regarding D/2017/810<https://online.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/DA/IndividualApplication?tpklapappl=1308565> at 13 Swanson Street, Erskineville.

    text: "I would like to strongly object to this proposed development on 84-122
      Taylor Road.\r\n\r\nI live on Woodlands Drive and moved to this area zoned Rural
      Non-Urban to escape urban density and to help encourage wildlife.  There is
      a large number of marsupial wildlife that currently inhabit where this development
      is proposed that will be displaced.\r\n\r\nIf the land here can be re-zoned
      for one persons financial gains what is to stop other local land-owners from
      doing the same?  This beautiful pocket of rural land in the Redlands will be
      transformed into the ever more prevalent urban congestion we see so much of
      in Brisbane. \r\n\r\nTaylor Road is not designed to handle all the extra traffic
      that this development would bring. How many more vehicles will now compete with
      wildlife on the road?\r\n\r\nThis proposal is totally against the current rural
      dwelling culture that so many of us have moved here to enjoy.  Why should our
      lifestyles be shattered so one person can line their pockets? Rural Non-Urban
      zoning means exactly that."

    text: Goodness! What a can of worms. Let me get this straight... so the station
      that we didn't need, but the big players at Southland wanted (they figured they'd
      get more punters, therefore more $$$) will in fact attract commuters looking
      for parking. This will impact on the humble shoppers who will find parking difficult
      if not impossible, so will be deterred from shopping there (unless they live
      near the Frankston train line), even though "studies have shown" that most shoppers
      prefer to take a car if they have one. My local strip shopping centre is looking
      better all the time - so is the bus. Whoops sorry, got off the track, we were
      discussing the parking nightmare in surrounding streets which will further be
      compounded by all this. Yikes!

      Centres like Southland put extra stress on this infrastructure but what is missed
      is a contribution to our transport network.  There could be a win win for both
      the shopping centres and the local transport infrastructure where there is on
      & off ramps over and under gorund which reduces the amount of traffic lights
      and increases the amount of car spaces.  This would improve the traffic flow

    text: It is appalling to hear what is proposed for that site. I share all Cheryl
      Follett's concerns for the integrity of the environment. It is pleasing to read
      both Ms Follett's and Rodriguez's comments. These are people who care - and
      are brave enough to speak out - without them we may be over-run with random
      inappropriate development. Apart from the parking issues, the thought of 36-plus
      garbage bins lining that street is nauseating. This slums concept is disgraceful
      for 1. the neighbours 2. the visual impact of the site and 3. for the poor souls
      who live in them.

    text: "@Cheryl, you may be surprised to know, that there is currently several
      properties at the corner of Mathieson & Karen Sts & Nepean Hwy, with a VCAT
      application pending, (the original development proposal was for 240 apartments
      on the site of 3 now demolished dwellings, which was rejected by council).  The
      developer has erected a site sales office and appears to be going to presell
      the apartments, likely in advance of a VCAT/PlanningDept ruling.  Of course,
      the apartments all typically have 1 car space per dwelling, but the reality
      is that most property owners have 2 or more cars per dwelling, and use their
      car space/garage for storage, preferring to park their cars on the street.  This
      development and several others in the area will rapidly devastate the already
      crowded street parking."

        Hi Cheryl,
        Apologies as I had the number wrong, my mistake. That matter was considered, and approved by Council in May. The application originally attracted 15 objections and saw two revisions of plans which sought to address the concerns raised in those objections. Had Council rejected these revisions, the danger we faced is that any subsequent VCAT appeal undertaken by the applicant would have reverted to the original plans, thwarting any gains made for residents. Council granted what is referred to as a Notice of Decision which allows for a period on time for objectors to take the matter to VCAT, none have done so.
        The origins of the owners is not something that Council is generally made aware of, nor empowered to consider as part of the application. FIRB matters are also outside the realm of Council consideration. The zoning of the area does allow for developments of greater density, there are a significant number of "live" applications in that area. Having said that I can appreciate the concerns you have in relation to parking provisions, as a Council we are continuing to lobby the Planning Minister to change the state regulations to better reflect today's level of car ownership.
        Councils is currently undertaking a review of our Neighbourhood Character guidelines and overall retail strategy, all interested parties will be able to make submissions.
        I know my explanation may not have allayed your concerns, however I hope I have made the process a little clearer and I do encourage you to participate in our upcoming consultation.
        Regards
        Geoff

      As a resident of the street I was attracted to buy in this location because
      the street has a nice residential feeling and vibe as someone mentioned above.
      I purchased one of the historic terraces that add character and make this street
      such a pleasure to live in. Building this boarding house will take away the
      character of the street. In addition with the current construction in the area,
      new bars and cafes and the commuters that park on the street to go to Redfern
      station has made in increasing difficult for residents of the street to find
      parking, it is hard at all times of the day. I am concerned about the potential
      unsocial behaviour and additional noise the building may attract. Another concern
      is there has been a huge increase in development applications across Sydney
      that are being approved by councils under the proviso of providing affordable
      housing, but once erected the developer is charging extremely high rents that
      defeat the reason and the foundation of affordable housing, it will simply become
      a money earner for a greedy developer. '

      from past experience we know only too well that it really doesn't matter what
      objections Toowoomba residents have - things like this re-development will continue.
      \ \r\n\r\nPaul Hurley's comment is correct - to a DEGREE, TRC do have their
      hands tied by the Qld State Government, however some development applications
      should not even get this far.  It is a sad state of affairs when objections
      are heard at a 'special council meeting' your council votes AGAINST a proposed
      unit development but it still goes ahead.\r\n\r\nEast Toowoomba is not the place
      for unsightly units - no matter how hard a developer has tried to replicate
      a heritage appeal - we still lose the tranquil, heritage quality of the area
      - a reason I'm sure most of us moved there for. \r\n\r\nFor example: Plonking
      a lump of building on a 927sqm piece of dirt that is now going to house 3 x
      3 bedroom units that will have absolutely no living space/quality of  life appeal
      or appeal to the streetscape not to mention the traffic increase, lack of privacy
      and increased noise for neighbouring residents who have lived in the area for
      15+ years is unacceptable and let's not forget, surrounding these units are
      heritage homes - but hey we're just the rate payer, why should we matter.  \r\n\r\n"

      is rapidly being lost with the number of units being constructed - especially

      shops etc.  This strip was selected as it was opposite an "activity centre".  The
      shopping centre consists only of retail stores. The only activity is the library!!  Even
      now it''s hard to get a park at the shopping centre as we flood in more an more
      people in this immediate area.  This is just becoming untenable.  Please put
      a stop to it.  '

        of development occurring on Stud Road, opposite Stud Park.\nUnfortunately,
        I am not in a position to stem the development even though I share your concerns
        re the pressures placed on existing infrastructure, traffic congestion and
        parking. \nThere has been little investment in Stud Park and limited improvement
        in public transport in Rowville to service a growing population and yet higher
        density living is being forced upon the area. \nWhen applications come in,
        I do my best to provide common sense about what is appropriate for the area
        within the statutory framework we have to operate in.\nIf you would like to
        escalate your concerns, it would be great if you could lobby our local state
        MP Mr Kim Wells and also voice your concerns to the State Planning Mr Richard
        Wynne as to address the issues you rightfully highlight will need to be reflected
        at State Government level.\nKind regards  \nNicole Seymour\n\nTirhatuan Ward

    text: A number of well established "clean" businesses close to Domain Central
      will be adversely affected by this dusty, noisy, and potentially contaminating
      industry approved by council to be in our midst. We have retail businesses,
      glaziers, aluminium sales and scientific instrumentation companies surrounding
      this property that will all be subject to dust, noise, runoff and visual pollution.
      A large vehicle crushing plant is being installed within 4 metres of our rear
      boundary and that will pose a real source of noise and potential flying metal.
      The value of all local premises will also be significantly devalued by the proximity
      of this operation. As concerned business owners, we would appreciate an audience
      with the council to express our concerns over this operation. Besides the detrimental
      effect on local businesses, I cannot understand how such an operation can be
      approved within 250 metres of local housing.

    text: "Considering the catchment of the new population it is disappointing not
      to see BBQ facilities and limited picnic shelters, Council should seriously

      to cater for multiple uses and provide facilities for this purpose. Council
      needs to lead the way and require developers to provide suitable facilities.

      and exotics to ‘provide additional colour and variety to the softscape palette’
      is not acceptable practice for similar bio-banking and offset sites, therefore

      text: "Hi Skye and Interested Parties,\n\nAs discussed previously and covered
        in a local article I am disappointed the developer chose to frog step council
        and go to VCAT without awaiting a Council decision. This was a complex development
        and whilst Knox Council has a great hit rate on complying with the 60 days
        we could not on this occasion and the developer cut the decision makers out
        of the process which was extremely disappointing. It’s important Councillors
        as decision makers are empowered by the planning process and are given every
        opportunity to listen to local concerns.\n\nTo note 75% of applications in
        Knox are decided within 60 days.\n\nI note there were several concerns about
        traffic and parking. At this time the requirement for housing in the State
        Framework is 1 parking spot for 2 bedrooms or less and 2 parking spots for
        3 or more and unfortunately that cannot be overridden as is noted in the VCAT
        decision.\n\nI understand there are also concerns around the safety of road
        users and pedestrians along that corridor and also the general level of traffic.
        I accept VCAT’s view that the proposed extra traffic which will be added by
        this development will generally not have a notable impact, but moving forward
        I understand why residents are concerned regarding the nature of a one lane
        bridge within the vicinity which places extra pressure on congestion at times.\n\nThis
        is an issue which I have raised with the Directors of City Futures (Planning)
        and Engineering and Infrastructure at Knox Council. I will be discussing this
        with State and Federal members (and candidates considering the upcoming state
        election) and I encourage you to as well. Council in this space will play
        an advocacy role in terms of any infrastructure upgrades as VicRoads maintains
        Wantirna Rd as it is a major Rd. It is worth nothing that the Wantirna Bridge
        was only just recently updated, unfortunately without a lane being added in.\n\nMoving
        forward, the area along Wantirna Rd as is known is designated an activity
        centre which council had requested a height limit of 9 metres in. But upon
        adoption a limit of 13.5 metres was placed on areas like Wantirna Rd, which
        is in a place of Principal Public Transport Network. As such, not in a residential
        area as it faces a major rd. However, that decision has not impacted the residential
        policy in areas surround where we continue to have lower scale housing where
        single and dual occupancy is preferred. Due to the Urban Growth Boundaries
        not being grown at this time and all metropolitan areas being asked to cope
        with more housing as Melbourne Grows and as do housing prices it is very unlikely
        we would go backwards in terms of where we currently are along areas adjacent
        to the PPTN routes. The argument which can be made is the need to keep up
        infrastructure needs. And as discussed I will be having those conversations
        and endeavouring to advocate on Council to look at the issues raised by locals
        along that corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYours in Kind\n\nJackson\n\n\n[cid:]\n\n\nJackson

        you will see from my above comments this area is designated an ‘activity area’
        of sorts as per the Minister for Plannings decision, hence developers attempting
        to yield more from land along Wantirna Rd where the Smart Bus route runs along.\n\nYou
        correctly state that the decision has been made, however I need to respectfully
        correct you and advise that no decision was made by Council either by delegation
        to its Planning Officers and certainly not by myself or mr Cr Colleagues.
        The developer took their application straight to VCAT after the 60 day period
        which we could not comply with due to the complexities of the application.
        VCAT then approved the application and Council has no choice but to issue
        a permit.\n\nI spoke to several residents and two clearly above your own comment
        on this site and always have, of which I am happy to discuss with you in further
        length.\n\nIt is extremely disappointing that this developer chose to bypass
        the decision makers and thus removing an important part of the decision which
        allows for greater community consultation which is so important and a principle
        by which I live by in my role.\n\nMy role as a Cr is to listen to the community
        on a range of issues and I will keep doing as such.\n\nThanks again for getting

      text: "Good Afternoon Merrilyn,\n\nThanks for getting in touch about this specific
        planning proposal.\n\nAs you may have seen on the website in response to another
        community member I am currently seeking more information on this from the
        planner.\n\nAs per requirements of me I cannot comment on the proposal, but
        will look very closely into it and take into account objections, all aspects
        of applicable planning policies and information from relevant parties involved
        in planning when making my decision on this proposal and all proposals.\n\nI
        understand the community is very passionate about planing and want to ensure
        that the leafy green image of Knox is retained. I agree and that is why that
        wording is throughout our local planning policies and why he have such stringent
        conditions when it comes to landscape and private open space requirements.\n\nWithout
        knowing much on the plans as of yet or the zoning, I will assume that this
        is in an 'activity area' as was designated by the Minister for planning not
        at our request I will say. The minister decided recently that any area along
        Principal Public Transport Network routes (smart bus routes in this instance)
        that they want to see greater development around those areas to ensure it
        takes these types of development away from mainly residential areas. Whilst
        we have our own local policies we must also fall in line with State policies
        as they supersede our own and theirs would take precedent if the two were
        to be inconsistent.\n\nKnox has changed a lot over the last 30 years and will
        continue to change, we are in a situation where over the next 20-30 years
        we will need to cater for 20,000 homes plus, and there is a clear direction
        from the minister for infill development to stop the urban growth boundaries.\n\nAs
        an elected Councillor I can tell you that I am committed to appropriate development
        in our municipality and one in which involves community feedback moving forward.\n\nThank
        you for getting in touch, I will get back to you with further and I will take
        your email as an objection if you could give some further grounds for your
        reasons.\n\nCheers, Jackson.\n\n\nYours in Kind\n\nJackson\n\n\n[cid:]\n\n\nJackson

      power to heritage list properties. This property should have been listed in
      the heritage schedule to Waverley Council's 2012 Local Environmental Plan (LEP).
      It was 121 years old at the time, in excellent condition and highly valued by
      our community. Council could have taken proactive action to protect this home
      and other Victorian homes in our area. I hope that all councillors will now
      take action and object to the demolition of this beautiful home.

        John, I agree. I am astounded this house was not heritage listed. Unfortunately Councillors no longer have any say in DA matters although staff and the WDAP do. Complying developments take planning out of Council control completely although we can make objections.

      as high as the apartments around, 6 stories high, no more,  our large morgage
      will now be very hard to get payed off if we ever sell as the price will dive

        Hi Luke

        Thank you for writing to me regarding your concern about development happening in the area surrounding your new home.  I am pleased that to hear you are currently enjoying your home that you have recently moved into and if you have not lived within the City of Monash I hope you enjoy all that the City has to offer.

        In regards to the specific concerns you raise, I have had the opportunity to get some advice regarding this application from Council’s Director City Development, Peter Panagakos.  Peter has advised that the proposed development you refer to is for the construction of three buildings ranging in height from 4 to 18 storeys to be used for 348 residential apartments, 106 serviced apartments/residential hotel, retail tenancies including a supermarket and cafe/food and drink premises.  The site is large, being approximately 9,600 square metres, and encompasses the land at 807-811 Warrigal Road and 1513-1517 Dandenong Road, Oakleigh.

        The application was considered by Council at the 31 January 2017 Council meeting where the application was not supported.  The applicant had appealed the decision to VCAT and hearings occurred in late May.  Council was represented at the VCAT hearings by Maddocks lawyers.

        During the course of VCAT’s consideration of the proposal, the applicant amended the plans. The main change was to reduce the overall height of the development from 18 storeys to 11 storeys (with some parts of the development being as low as 4 storeys).  Council considered these amended plans at a Special Council meeting held on 16 May 2017 and further reduced the height to 8 storeys.  Details of this decision can be accessed at: http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/About-Us/Council/Agendas-amp-Minutes/16-May-2017#agenda

        The rezoning of industrial land north of Dandenong Road in 2011 – including the subject site and the land where your apartment sits – was done so to facilitate the establishment of apartment/residential development in amongst existing (and new) commercial land uses. As part of this, planning policy for this area suggests building heights of up to 6 storeys facing Dandenong Road.  However, since the introduction of this planning policy, there has been new development which you can see in and around this area, which has slowly changed the context of the area.  In doing so, Council thinks that a building height higher than 6 storeys is appropriate in some areas.  In this regard, Council considers that a higher building height (than 6 storeys) is appropriate on this site, given that it is located on the corner of two main roads and also, given that the ‘main’ height of the development is oriented to the corner.  Council considers this in the context of existing apartment buildings that exist in this area.  While your apartment has a view west, toward this site, there is some distance between your property and the subject site.

        The decision on the future of this site was made by VCAT yesterday, 30th June and they have supported the amended plans, which allow for 11 storeys on the site.

        Your apartment building is one of the first buildings that have been developed in this precinct. It’s possible in future that more apartment buildings will be constructed near to you, to take advantage of Council’s policy for regeneration in this area. Council will consider each planning application as we receive them. As a land owner, you will be notified directly of any new development on land adjoining your apartment building.

        As this proposal is considered to be a large development in the context of the City of Monash, the decision by VCAT will be updated on the Monash website next week.  I would encourage you to monitor the website (you can subscribe to pages that you’re interested in) or contact James Heitmann, Principal Planner on 9518 3628 at any time for a further update.

        Kind regards, Rebecca

        luke here, we just moved into our lovely apartment on crnr drummond st and dandenong rd facing west to find that there will be a MASSAVE apartment building right in our face very soon! we will have no natural light at all, cant dry our cloths, cant grow plants, will look straight into there windows and parking is already terrible, how is this plan allowed? were in a 6 story building and so is next door once its built, and next to that is 5 stories, i understand we need more housing but you cant steal from people who have just perchased and will have everything good about there house taken away, you MUST only build as high as the apartments around, 6 stories high, no more, our large morgage will now be very hard to get payed off if we ever sell as the price will dive when people enter the apartment and see what has become of our lovely oakleigh views, very sad, doing all i can to stop it!

      block bounded by Marion Road, Cungena Ave, Bowaka Ave, and Wallala Ave. It is
      home to magpies, possums, lorikeets, and other birds. It is also frequented
      by a Boobook owl (Mopoke).\r\nThe removal of this significant gum tree would
      reduce shade, and the amenity created by attracting and supporting local bird
      life. The removal of this significant tree would also contribute to the warming
      effect through loss of shade and the absorbtion of less carbon dioxide. I ask
      that this tree be saved for future generations to enjoy."

    text: "Hello - I am sorry for this last minute response though I have been on
      holidays.  I never received notification of this DA, even though it will directly
      impact our living environment. \r\n\r\nAs it stands we are regularly kept awake
      from parties on the balconies from the high rise buildings of Jasper and Alba
      in the St Margaret's complex. The sound reverberates around this complex and
      descends on to our street - Jesmond Street. \r\n\r\nTaking into consideration
      that the balconies of Alba and Jasper only accommodate 10 -16 people, to then
      imagine that 14 roof top terraces are being considered which has the capacity
      to invite hundreds to party with no way to contain the noise, is unfathomable.

    text: "Having migrated to Australia 16 years ago from the largest muslim country
      in the world, my family and I are very well aware how loud, annoying and disturbing
      the prayer calls from the mosque are, especially during their Friday prayers
      and religious celebrations/ events, it will go on forever!! We were often awaken
      from our sleep at 3 in the morning from the dawn adzan call blaring over the
      PA and coming home from work trying to unwind after a long tiring day only to
      be bothered by the loud screeching prayer from the mosque, it was very irritating
      and frustrating. They will take great offense at any request of stopping their
      prayer calls over the PA and treated it as sign of provocation & disrespect
      to their religion! That was one of the reasons we have migrated to Australia.
      If you are ever within a 300 meter radius from any mosque in the Eastern/ Western
      suburbs on a Friday afternoon, you will understand what I mean. Not only noise
      pollution will be an issue, but also the traffic congestion and parking chaos
      will definitely ensue and create great inconvenience around the neighbourhood!
      Once a permit for building a mosque is given, other mosque-building requests
      will follow not long after and before you know it there will be mosques all
      over the Hills Shire and it will continue to grow all over Sydney and across
      the country! We also should consider the potential security threat this may
      bring to our neighbourhood in light of the many terror attacks that have been
      happening all around the world over the years, where radical/ fanatical point-of-views
      and indoctrination have been sermonised in some mosques.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex
      Tan \r\n"

      worship\r\n- The property in question is at the corner of Glenhaven Rd and Larapinta
      Pl. \r\n- This is not opposite the \"Tuck Shop\" but about 2km further down
      Glenhaven Road \r\n- 1 Larapinta Place was sold in April 2017 for $3.8m (see

    text: "Hi,\r\nAs a resident and property owner on Glenhaven Rd, I am also very
      concerned and disappointed. \r\nI am very concerned that another Place of worship
      (regardless of religion) would be allowed to be located on a Road as busy as
      Glenhaven Rd which is already struggling to cope with the traffic. \r\nI mean
      really, with 2 places of worship already on this road, 2 retirement villages
      expanding, a busy school with no drop-off or Pick-up parking solution, a lousy
      and dangerous intersection at the end of the road by Old Northern Rd where we’re
      waiting for a fatality before the traffic lights are prioritised, 3 Day care
      centers and from what I understand another one under DA, and yet here we are
      taking about another large public gathering area to be built \r\nWe should also
      not forget that soon we will have 12 new dwellings with the only access being
      directly on Glenhaven Rd and 4500 houses just around the corner in North Kellyville.\r\nI
      am disappointed that any religious group would be so blunt to go ahead with
      acquiring a property without first raising it with the council, as confirmed
      by Robyn Preston, the Deputy Mayor, which means 2 things:\r\n1-\tThey know they
      will raise the funds needed.\r\n2-\tThey also know that eventually the council
      will give its approval. After all, who wants to be seen as anti-Islam at the
      present time ?\r\n\r\nP.S. Obviously as there is no planning application alert
      for the planned Mosque yet, our comments are being listed against the wrong
      address. It should be Corner of Larapinta Place and Glenhaven Rd \r\n\r\nRegards."

      a few years ago\r\n\r\nthe mosque in Annangrove didn't bring house prices down

      resident for a long time like yourself and have invested in the area and only
      wished to establish a peaceful place of worship just like anyone else is allowed
      to in this beautiful and free country of ours\r\n\r\nplease please i hope we've

      impact on traffic on the already busy Glenhaven Rd and the number of people
      the mosque will attract.\r\n\r\nThe impact on the quiet Cul-de-sac  adjoining
      the land and the potential loss of value of the expensive homes in that street
      .\r\n\r\nThe impact on our way of life in Glenhaven. I for one , like to go
      for a run in  shorts and a singlet without having to worry about offending the
      Muslim culture .\r\n\r\nThe overall look of Glenhaven and its Rural aspect.\r\n\r\nHuge
      concerns shown daily on Tv news reports , one being highlighted in the news
      today , indicates that some of that particular culture have total disregard
      for our Laws and those in authority.  I am concerned that will impact Glenhaven.\r\n\r\nThe
      impact on safety in our area.\r\n\r\nThe impact of traffic and safety for residence
      living near by.\r\n\r\nThe impact on our freedom using our local swimming pools
      and the pressure for those pools to close at certain times.\r\n\r\nThe cultural
      laws that will impact our local residence to cater for the mosque.\r\n\r\nThe
      impact of noise at certain times.\r\n\r\nThe message on the internet states
      the close proximity to  \"Jummah location \" (International school ) at Kellyville.
      Perhaps that area would be more suited for the proposed mosque. \r\n\r\nThe
      message also states how the location at Glenhaven is a great size for onsite
      parking and \"future growth\".  \r\nThis is also great concern for the impact
      in our area.\r\n\r\nThe link if any residence in Glenhaven are interested for
      their information is :\r\nhttps://hdms.org.au/masjid-in-the-hills/\r\n\r\nI

      I have seen that looks decent. The current townhouses in the area of Oxley Park,
      Cambridge Park and surrounding suburbs look mirror image to one another. This
      design is a different look and one that definitely needs an approval from Council.
      \r\n\r\nNot sure why council keeps approving mediocre designs, it's a let down
      for the suburb and quality of built is very poor. I have been to some of the

      respond, stated, \"that it was public parking and therefore not to be considered\"\r\nSo
      there you have it, - Randwick Council could not care less about street parking
      needs - and this, in an old established area where homes and units were built
      without parking spaces.\r\nIt appears they wait for people to complain and then
      install timed parking - brilliant stuff.\r\n"

    text: I object to this planned development. There is already an amazing c&k kindergarten
      just around the corner who offer above and beyond what any planned facility
      could ever offer. The added traffic congestion is not justifiable to local residents
      and puts children's safety at risk when using the existing crossing or being

      not a development that the local community wants or needs!

        All applications are assessed by Council staff according to the Moreton Bay Regional Town Plan which has been approved by the State Government.  In some cases an approval is made by the staff but in this case, as it is an Impact Assessable Application, it will come to Council for a final decision.



        Before this assessment comes to Council, I, as an individual Councillor, am not permitted to comment either way as to my support or not of the application.

        It is your right as a resident of the region to make a submission regarding the proposal.  It must be addressed to:

        The Assessment Manager,

        Moreton Bay Regional Council,

        PO Box 159,

      child care centre in this area? There are a plethora of options in the area

      current provision of excellent and high standards of early childhood education
      in the area, all of which need to remain sustainable. \r\n\r\nTo add another
      service in such close proximity to one that already exits, and has done so for
      40 years, would demonstrate a lack of commitment to high quality early childhood
      services that are deeply connected within our community, and to our children's
      well being.\r\n\r\nPlease don't dismantle the heart of our future generation's
      early education by creating opportunity for further competition in what is already
      a congested environment.\r\n\r\nPlease support community organisations such
      as C&K Strathpine to remain viable into the future, so that they can continue
      to provide an incredibly rich and precious learning experience for what is well

      within 100m (on Brennan Pde) which provides quality care and education to Strathpine

      on Gympie Road next to Officeworks! Not to mention the other existing centre
      already on bell pockets road. If this one goes ahead it will be such an overkill.
      The traffic, the congestion, the noise will be horrendous. Strathpine has so
      many empty shops on the main road - build it there if you must.

      Works! Why do we need another especially being so close to an excellent  well
      established C & K kindergarten a hop skip and a jump from this proposed centre.
      I dont want to think about the traffic it would cause on an already busy road,
      not to mention the parking of cars. I do believe you would have some very unhappy
      residences in the area! Come on guys it just doesnt make sense......Lets show

    text: "I object to the opening of another centre 100 meters away from a beautiful
      C & K Centre.\r\nThe teachers provide above and beyond care and education to
      our community of children. Their programme is far above any standard I have
      ever seen in any of the other centres.  This additional centre would put an
      enormous pressure on the C & K Kindy and may mean shutting its doors. In such
      a socio-economic area it would be a HUGE loss for that community. To take away
      such a wonderful education and start to the families and children of this area.
      Please put the funding into the centres that have been providing an outstanding
      service for the last 40 years. \r\nResidents in the area have already been complaining
      for years about the traffic from local business, schools and centres. It will
      be unfair to the local residents to add more congestions and noise to such a
      peaceful area. If anything this would be a perfect location for a new and updated
      area for a community library to educate and support the people in this community.
      Please do not go ahead with the development of this additional centre."

    text: 36 of 50 Childcare centres in Strathpine (or post code 4500) return vacancies.
      This region is a saturated market of median age of 30 as at 2011 census. Arguably,
      they've given birth to their 1.9 children who are now beyond child care age.  Please
      explain the "planning" associated with the approval from MBRC for another Childcare
      centre in this suburb, only a stone's throw from the existing Strathpine C&K.
      Until the investigation MBRC undertook to justify even considering this development
      is declared, I remain strongly objected to the development. Councillor Gillam
      only marginally retained his seat. I suggest Ccl Gillam consults with the affected
      community and explains the proposed development in detail before any decision
      is finalised. It would appear the "planning" authority is not planning for the
      future, at all.

    text: I would like to ask Mayor Sutherland and Cr Gilliam where they think the
      cars created by this centre are going to park. If they knew anything about Bells
      Pocket Rd they would know how busy it is already and that there is no where
      for the extra cars to park. Being a resident of 40 years here on Bells Pocket
      Rd I can tell you it has become more congested with each passing year. The amount
      of cars on this road has more than quadrupled in that time. Also this proposed
      area is on a corner and as far as I am aware you are not allowed to park on
      or near corners. Then there is the school  crossing just down from that with
      yellow lines for no parking. In the past 2 years alone Council has allowed heavy
      trucks to constantly go up and down this road and now they are allowing another
      child care centre to be built near other ones. Mother Duck Child Care is only
      a 5 minute walk from this proposed one. We do not need another centre here in
      Strathpine. Within a short area alone we have YMCA near the Shopping Centre,
      a child care centre near KFC, Mother Duck in Bells Pocket Rd and a new C&K centre
      opening up in May near Red Rooster. That's not even counting the other ones
      within close distance in Lawnton, Bray Park and Petrie. This new centre is going
      to be an accident just waiting to happen as you will find parents will park
      on the Douglas Park side and run across the road to drop off and collect their
      children. I can see another accident happening if this is going to be the norm.
      You would be better off putting a child care centre in your planned university
      NOT in a suburban street that is NOT capable of supporting the traffic flow
      for it.

        Dear Amy,

        Thank you for your email regarding the application for a Child Care Centre at 108 Bells Pocket Road, Strathpine.
        Under the State Planning Act any person can apply for a Material Change of Use on any block of land in Queensland.   Whether Council approves this application is another matter.

        All applications are assessed by Council staff according to the Moreton Bay Regional Town Plan which has been approved by the State Government.  In some cases an approval is made by the staff but in this case, as it is an Impact Assessable Application, it will come to Council for a final decision.

        Before this assessment comes to Council, I, as an individual Councillor, am not permitted to comment either way as to my support or not of the application.

      around the corner. Strathpine already has plentiful child care services, adding
      another so close is unnecessary. The lovely, peaceful street will be filled

      c&k centre right around the corner that provides an excellent service and another
      day care centre down the road. There is already an abundance of centers in the
      Strathpine area. I also feel being in a school zone that it would lead to congestion
      of traffic, creating angry drivers in a residential area. Please do not overdevelop
      a lovely are.

    text: I would be very grateful if this application could be reconsidered.  I think
      the congestion in this area is bad enough already, the Centre proposed would
      increase the traffic and noise unnecessarily for the residents in this area.  There
      are plenty of child care options in the area and in my opinion, this centre
      would threaten the fantastic options our community already has.

        Dear Matthew,

        Thank you for your email regarding the application for a Child Care Centre at 108 Bells Pocket Road, Strathpine.
        Under the State Planning Act any person can apply for a Material Change of Use on any block of land in Queensland.   Whether Council approves this application is another matter.

        All applications are assessed by Council staff according to the Moreton Bay Regional Town Plan which has been approved by the State Government.  In some cases an approval is made by the staff but in this case, as it is an Impact Assessable Application, it will come to Council for a final decision.

        Before this assessment comes to Council, I, as an individual Councillor, am not permitted to comment either way as to my support or not of the application.
        It is your right as a resident of the region to make a submission regarding the proposal.  It must be addressed to:
        The Assessment Manager,
        Moreton Bay Regional Council,
        PO Box 159,
        Caboolture 4510

        It can also be emailed to:   or access on the web via http://pdonline.moretonbay.qld.gov.au

        You have until 5pm on the 9th June to lodge your submission.

        To assist you, I have included a link to Council’s website to help ensure that your submission is properly made.  This is important should you want to carry the matter further if you do not agree with the final decision made by Council.
        https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/general.aspx?id=9913

        I hope this information is of use.

        Best wishes,

    text: Please rethink the development of this Child Care Centre at this location.
      I object to this development as there is already a beautiful Kindy right around
      the corner providing wonderful care & education to the kids in this community.
      Why put another one so close! This will just add to the congestion of traffic
      and also make it increasingly harder to park in the area. It will also increase
      noise to an area where the surrounding streets are lovely and quiet!

    text: "To:  Development Assessment Officer regarding application ref. 100/789/2017
      Application to remove Significant Tree on the boundary of 14/12 Cungena Ave,
      Park Holme.\r\nI live at 1/18 Cungena Avenue, Park Holme and vehemently oppose
      the application to remove the large gum tree which sits on the boundary of Number
      14 and number 12 Cungena Avenue.  I am aware that the owner of number 12 also
      wishes the tree to be maintained and it sits partly on his land.  It is a significant
      tree legally.  It is also significant to a large amount of native wildlife,
      particularly birds which are losing their habitat in this suburb at an alarming
      rate.  It is one of only two substantial sized trees remaining on the block
      (around thirty original house blocks), and most of the other blocks in the suburb
      have only one or two remaining larger trees as well.  This means that bird life
      suffers significantly, with fewer places in which to nest, breed, feed and roost.
      \ When the distance between trees is increased birds have more difficulty establishing
      territory and ultimately populations decrease.  Also trees provide shade and
      contribute to moderating temperature in suburbs which are increasingly paved
      to the extent that water cannot be absorbed into the ground and storm water
      run-off is increased significantly.\r\nOn the morning of April 20th 2017 I spoke
      with the arborists who were assessing this tree and they said, “The tree is
      very healthy.”  (Around 10 years ago I made inquiries about why so many significant
      trees were being cut down in our suburb and was told that they were all diseased.
      \ I simply do not believe that was the case then and I have it straight from
      the arborist’s mouth on this occasion that the tree is healthy.)\r\n\r\nI regularly
      hear a Boobook Owl calling from it during the night.  In fact I recorded the
      sound this past Saturday morning at 6.30am to verify the fact.  There are not
      many trees left in this neighbourhood which could be home to owls, as they need
      tree hollows to breed.  There are no doubt other species which nest in this
      tree such as lorikeets and magpies.  I'm also aware of possums which live there.
      \ Possums are also dependent on tree hollows.   The resident possums would likely
      be killed in the process of tree removal (or even significant trimming of the
      tree) and if they did escape they would have nowhere to go.  \r\n\r\nI note
      with interest that council email signature recognises the Kaurna people as the
      ongoing custodians of the land.  I'm sure the Kaurna people would be horrified
      by the extent of local development and would want this tree to stay and to continue
      sustaining wildlife on this block.\r\n\r\nIt is very sad that decisions are
      too often made on a short term economic basis.  The developer who purchased
      the land would have known that the tree was significant.  The regulations surrounding
      significant trees state that they can be trimmed or removed if they pose a threat
      to existing buildings but does not allow for people to purchase the land without
      a building being under threat and then propose to build and cut the tree down
      as part of the development plan.\r\nI had hoped that the developer would understand
      that the tree is an asset to his property, with the amenity and shade that it
      will provide but sadly that is apparently not the case. \r\nI have been a rate
      payer in Marion Council for over 20 years.  I have been a volunteer removing
      graffiti in my suburb for over 10 years and I regularly pick up rubbish from
      my street because I wish to preserve the amenity of the area in which I choose
      to live.  I firmly believe that development should not proceed at the expense
      of the amenity to existing residents.  Marion council’s “desired character”
      for the area is “medium density” and that isn’t unreasonable in itself, but
      it becomes unreasonable when the result is the removal of the majority of trees
      in a suburb.  Park Holme is sadly a very different place to what it was when
      I bought here 22 years ago.  I don’t object to new buildings except where they
      adversely affect the existing residents and the health of the environment in
      which we live. \r\n I've seen too many trees disappear from the immediate area
      already and would not want to see this one go because I remained silent.  Thank
      you for your consideration of my comments.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nHelen Whitford\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      to do with this site/application or permeability.  Perhaps Gary meant a different
      C number.  \r\nThere are no planning controls at present that indicate a permeability
      requirement of anything different to the orthodox provision of 20% as stipulated
      by Rescode. \r\nOur proposal has a permeability level of 28%.   It thus does
      better than the 20% that is expected of it by Rescode.\r\nNot only that, and
      on top of that, we are ‘volunteering’, to re-harvest water from the roof via
      water tanks.  This is IN ADDITION to the 28% that is natural permeable area.\r\nThere
      is no policy requirement to have water tanks.\r\nThis proposal could scrap its
      water tanks, have 8% less permeable area and still be compliant in relation
      to permeability.\r\nIt is untenable to suggest that the outcome we propose in
      relation to permeability is therefore unacceptable."

      St residents left off the notification list of this DA? The works will be conducted
      less than 15 metres from the front boundary of our properties. \r\n\r\n2. The
      details of the works proposed to the college’s Salisbury St fencing are inadequately
      disclosed. The architect drawings for this section of the site are missing from
      the DA. It is only when reading parts of the Heritage documentations that I
      found their proposal for Salisbury St. It seems a deliberate move to keep us
      unaware of their plans (and possibly the reason why council hasn’t formally
      notified us of the DA?)\r\n\r\n3. Disclosures/notifications aside - what they
      are proposing is hideous, and not keeping with the aesthetics of a heritage
      school. The fence will be more than 3m tall. The style of fencing is more akin
      to a correctional facility. I believe it’s unnecessary, as the school is already
      fenced on the Salisbury St side (to a height of approx 1.8m) and is already
      inaccessible. If the college is concerned about students jumping from the College
      to the street - why can't they be told to keep out of the gardens and not jump
      the fence? \r\n\r\n4. Finally - Waverley College rebuilt the whole Salisbury
      St fence less than 2 years ago, as part of another DA. Why are they trying to
      sneak through more works, which will once again majorly disrupt residents of
      Salisbury St in terms of noise, dust and access."

      will be used from the car wash into the Maroochydore River. \r\nAnother concern
      is the entrance of the shops. With only one road that is extremely busy without
      this development, will the thoroughfare be able to handle the extra traffic
      without causing a back up of cars holding up traffic. \r\nI have seen many times
      from living in Bli Bli for 14 years cars backed up for miles on David Low Way
      both ways from accidents, cars turning against the traffic to enter Quirky Circle
      and at peak times especially in the afternoon.\r\nIf this development is approved,
      will the development be changed once businesses are operational, to fix any
      traffic disputes. Or will Bli Bli residences just have to put up with it.\r\nI
      am unsure why a car wash will be next to the Maroochy River when people are
      paying for a service to eat and drink and look out at the River listening to
      the machinery of the sprayers. \r\nI am not against this development but I am
      against putting in a Car wash business right next to a River. Car wash outlets
      are currently in close proximity to Bli Bli such as Pacific Paradise, Nambour

    text: "Dear Mary \r\nMy name is Gill Kube, my husband and I had three acres of
      our land resumed by compulsory land take from Sunshine Coast council, council
      gave notice formally in sept 2011 and it took until 2013 to formalise the gazette
      of the land acquisition, in the time leading the council officers acted abruptly
      and with bully tactics and continued to assert our land was worth nothing.\r\nEven
      sending an official letter seeking that we donate our land to council for drainage
      of the up stream urban developments storm water disposal.\r\n\r\nIt is now 2017
      and we have been forced by councils bully tactics and unwillingness to provide
      a fair compensation for three acres of prime land in the the very valuable suburb
      of Bli Bli to have to take council to the land court to receive a fair compensation
      payment. ( council have provided $14,000 for land of three acres through the
      centre of our property and not down the boundary as would or could have been
      less disruptive and over existing easement)\r\nDon't think that information
      was ever disclosed to councillors by council officers in meeting regards our
      land take! \r\nWe have council continued delays to court time tables and none
      disclosure of court directed compliance to supply documents etc.\r\n\r\nI have
      wrote dozens of letters to My local councillor Mr Robinson and the Mayor Jamison
      \ and regretfully they have not been able to help achieve any fair or favourable
      outcome, Mr Robinson passes your enquirers on to the legal teams in council
      to attempt baffle you with bull shit and delay you receiving any fair compensation
      in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIt is such a distressing and health effecting situation
      when Sscc want to steal your home or land from under your nose and will not
      provide fair compensation. \r\nMary be prepared for a long hard fight, go to
      the media, seek public support because you are about to enter the fight of your
      life.\r\nIf you are not a contributor or local developer you will certainly
      not be treated with respect or fairly by councils officers that deal with these
      matters.\r\n\r\nAs for our local elected councillors they are about as useful
      to us constituents as \"Tits on a bull\" so to speak \r\n\r\nSorry to say Mr
      Robinson will not actively have your matter mentioned in councils meetings to
      help support you and receive help in fairness.\r\nI'm very doubtful that all
      local councillors have been informed that councils legal officers have engaged
      expensive Barristers and two sets of valuers and engineers and very expensive
      court actions etc to try to avoid making fair compensation payments to myself
      and husband.\r\nThe amount that council would have spent,up to date would be
      in excess of $400,00 not to mention time and efforts to delay and bully ourselves.\r\nWe
      are obtaining right to information documents on how much council have spent
      on legal and other costs just on our case alone in efforts to avoid fair compensation.\r\nBut
      if this was a developer or a councillors having land resumed they certainly
      don't have to go through the ringer like we have had to.\r\n\r\nLook up other
      cases council have acted unfairly.\r\nEg sunshine council verse savimaki \r\n\r\nSo
      sorry Mary to hear your distress I truly hope you receive a fair go, but certainly
      don't expect it! \r\nWrite to every councillor and the media, and your local
      Mp everyone you can think of, because it is well documented the fair payments
      some development companies have received for payment for land acquisition that
      council have taken from developers.\r\n\r\nEg council took land from developer
      Mr Covey at Burtons rd Bli Bli payed Mr covey $1.5 million for flood effected
      cane land.\r\nCouncil Took a small strip of land along the edge of the new cutters
      ridge estate on David low way and paid covey over $1 million \r\nCouncil paid
      over $ 4 million to developer for flood effected cane land on Coolum Yandina
      road for solar farm, no flood effected land on that road has sold for that amount
      before council paid developer that amount.\r\n\r\nCouncil paid over 10 million
      for flood effected land on David low way Bli Bli for rural flood plain to be
      excessively filled for new Golf course.\r\n\r\nSo the moral of this story is
      it doesn't matter what you know it matters who you know with regards to fair
      treatment from council and its councillors! \r\nThese payments were made quickly
      and fairly without court intervention! Unlike ourselves almost seven years and
      currently council legal teams attempt delays in our court case.\r\n\r\nKind
      regard to you Mary and good luck hopefully you will be fairly treated and compensated,
      but don't rely on this happening.\r\n\r\nAll the best \r\nGill Kube \r\n"

      so much benefit to those working and living in the area and has constantly been
      used seems nothing but counter productive and simply in the best view of the

      North Wharf/Siddeley Street precinct and pedestrian traffic has increased substantially
      in recent years due to the development of DFO and the South Wharf precinct.
      The reinstatement and reopening of this pedestrian bridge would allow for safer
      pedestrian access between Spencer Street, Flinders Street, Melbourne Quarter
      and into the North Wharf/Siddeley Street precinct. I strongly object to the
      demolition of this bridge as it is likely to be a long term strategic benefit
      to pedestrian safety if repurposed effectively. For information, I am a permanent
      and long term resident of Flinders Wharf at 60 Siddeley Street.

    text: "Dear All, \r\n\r\nIt is clear that residents do NOT want this child care
      centre, the area is R2, Low Density Residential and while child care centres
      may be approved for operation in R2 zones they need to demonstrate merit and
      it is this that is the issue. \r\n\r\nThe areas of non compliant with on site
      parking must be addressed to be dealt with within the site rather than ask local
      residents to dedicate public roads for this centres private commercial gain.
      Is they can not be dealt with on site then it is clear the application does
      not have merit and should be refused.  \r\n\r\n27 Duncan St is not a suitable
      site for a child care centre based upon merit for the following reasons. \r\n\r\nTRAFFIC\r\n\r\n-The
      centre is not placed upon an arterial road or public transport path. \r\n-The
      traffic study survey data was taken 3 days before the Easter Weekend. Many people
      take holidays around Easter and thus the survey was not taken on a day when
      normal traffic conditions are present. \r\n-The road occupancy survey considers
      a radius of vacant car spots within a 250m radius. This is not suitable. All
      parents, which i am one, know that parking needs to be immediately opposite
      the drop off point. \r\n-The Provision of a 17.4 metre long (3 car spaces) ‘15
      Minute’ time restricted parking the hours of 7:30am - 9:00am and 3:00-6:00pm,
      Monday to Friday, with unrestricted parking to be maintained at all other times
      will affect residents ability to park overnight in these locations and when
      returning home after work. This is a public road and the centre seeks to utilise
      part of it for its own amenity and profit. \r\n-The weekend traffic has not
      been assessed. Traffic congestion on the weekend is worse that weekdays when
      people use their car to get to work. The traffic report ignores this. \r\n-The
      application is non-compliant with the council controls with respect to parking.
      Council controls require 4 staff car parks, the development provides 1. \r\n-The
      application is non-compliant with council controls for pick up and drop off
      parking. 3 -4 are required. zero are provided within the site.\r\n-No service
      vehicle provision is provided. This is a commercial operation and will require
      drop offs for food and maintenance.  \r\n-The traffic report considers that
      the traffic impacts are acceptable, however they are not to the residents in
      the surrounding area. We don't want an increases in traffic, the surrounding
      roads are congested narrow streets such as Sackville St are used as though fares
      from the arterial roads. \r\n\r\nNOISE\r\n- The provisions for noise reduction
      are not sufficient. The residents of 25 and 29 Duncan street will be detrimentally
      effected. Their right to have peaceful enjoyment of their property will not
      continue. \r\n-The report notes that play may occur for up to 3.5 hours a day
      rather than typical centres which play outside for 1 hour per day. The expected
      ACCC dBa level for the amount of children the centre wants to care for is 78-81
      dBa. Note the current noise level is only 35dBa. Would you want a doubling of
      noise next to your home, all day, every day?\r\n-Again the survey results are
      taken around the Easter holiday. This will skew the results and the survey cannot
      be relied upon. \r\n\r\nAMENITY \r\n-The proposed cost of works is concerning.
      Capital improvements of less than $100,000 will unlikely be sufficient to modify
      the property from its existing use. \r\n-Signage is essential for the operation
      of a commercial venture and it erecting should be governed by the consent rather
      than be conducted with the exempt development provision. \r\n-proposed operating
      hours on Weekends will prevent residents from the peaceful enjoyment of their
      property over a time when rest is required. \r\n-Surrounding child care centres
      have spots available and additional supply will hurt the viability of the existing
      centres\r\n-The application is non-compliant with D11 2 (vij), parking, and
      should be rejected on this basis alone. \r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nThe residents
      of Duncan and Sackville St.  \r\n"

    text: "My wife and I are the applicants, my wife knows how to operate child care
      centres in areas that have a lot of traffic, parking issues and residents (for
      example in Bondi Junction, Bondi Beach, Randwick and Rose Bay.) We rely on experts
      to provide evidence, as professionals we have faith that expertly trained traffic
      engineers hold the qualifications required to advise on traffic, safety and
      parking issues. The traffic engineers from Traffix and the Randwick City Council
      employees have recommended this DA for 24 children for approval. I urge the
      councillors to listen to over 100 local residents who have hand signed a petition
      supporting this DA, many who live in Duncan Street Maroubra.  Please do not
      clog the Land and Environment Court with unnecessary hearings, that will in
      the end support the applicant as the Council has recommended this DA to be approved.\r\n\r\nPLEASE
      READ THIS EXPERTS REPORT AS PROOF THAT THERE ARE NO PARKING, TRAFFIC OR SAFETY
      ISSUES RELATED TO THIS DA.\r\n\r\nDear Theresa, \r\nWe refer to the subject
      development and proposal for a child care centre. Comments from residents have
      since been received, particularly with respect for traffic impacts on Duncan
      Street. \r\n\r\nWe have reviewed each comment and responded to the key concerns
      generally raised. Reference should be made to the Traffic Impact Assessment
      prepared by TRAFFIX (Reference: 16.113r01v05) which was submitted with the development
      application. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Concerns about proximity to intersections and U-turns.
      \r\n\r\nTRAFFIX Response: \r\n\r\nWith respect for developments situated near
      an intersection, the off-street parking standard AS2890.1 (2004) illustrates
      locations where vehicular access to a site would be prohibitive (Figure 3.1).
      We interpret the intent behind this requirement as to off-set driveways from
      intersections to discourage motorists from cutting across oncoming traffic to
      access a property. In the case of the proposed development, the existing access
      is located outside of this prohibited area, and therefore no increased risk
      of danger is anticipated in this respect. \r\n\r\nWe observe than Duncan Street
      is well connected to the surrounding road network, with signalised intersections
      provided at Torrington Road / Malabar Road and Maroubra Road / Malabar Road.
      As such, there is not considered to be an overarching reason why parents would
      perform a U-turn, as access to/from Malabar Road can be easily achieved from
      both ends of Duncan Street. \r\n\r\n2. Concerns about the narrow street width
      of Duncan Street \r\n\r\nTRAFFIX Response: \r\n\r\nThe peak traffic generation
      for the proposed development has been assessed to be 20 vehicle trips per hour,
      which equates to no more than an additional vehicle trip being generated every
      three minutes. Furthermore, due to the layout of the road network and orientation
      of the pick-up and drop-off restriction, it is anticipated that most parents
      will arrive in single file, which would disperse these already low volumes.
      \r\n\r\nIn any case the proposed pick-up and drop-off parking restriction is
      parallel in configuration, which requires less manoeuvring width as opposed
      to drivers entering and exiting directly from a property. \r\n\r\n3. Concerns
      about parking impacts from proposed on-street restriction. \r\n\r\nTRAFFIX Response:
      \r\n\r\nOn-Street parking surveys were commissioned in March 2016 during the
      morning and evening peak periods anticipated for the proposed child care centre.
      The results were presented in the Traffic Impact Assessment report where a maximum
      occupancy of 73% was recorded of all parking spaces within 250 metres walking
      distance of the site. Vacancies were also regularly observed on Duncan Street.
      \r\n\r\nProvided that on-street conditions have largely remained the same, e.g.
      no major development or new parking restrictions have been signposted, there
      is considered to be capacity to accommodate a pick-up and drop-off parking restriction
      on Duncan Street. It is noteworthy that the proposed restriction will contain
      three spaces and is confined to the frontage of the subject site. \r\n\r\nOver
      a typical two hour pick-up and drop-off window during the morning and evening
      (7:00am to 9:00am and 4:00pm to 6:00pm), the average turnover for each space
      will be 15 minutes for the proposed capacity for 24 children (and assuming every
      child arrives by private transport). This is considered to be a reasonable timeframe
      and minimal reliance on unrestricted parking by parents is therefore anticipated.
      \r\n\r\n4. Concerns about staff parking. \r\n\r\nTRAFFIX Response: \r\n\r\nParking
      requirements for staff have been assessed in the Traffic Impact Assessment report.
      The site is located within proximity to bus stops on Maroubra Road that are
      serviced by an extensive number of routes that link to key regional destinations
      such as Maroubra Junction, Bondi Junction and the Sydney central business district.
      Staff will therefore be encouraged to take advantage of readily available public
      transport services and the applicant has proposed several incentives such as
      reimbursement and carpooling initiatives. \r\n\r\n5. Concerns about safety of
      pedestrians \r\n\r\nTRAFFIX Response: \r\n\r\nAll designated pick-up and drop-off
      parking for the proposed development is provided across the site frontage and
      will therefore avoid the need for any roads or driveways to be crossed when
      walking to/from the child care centre building. The applicant is open to regular
      communication with parents to induct and educate them about general road safety
      principles. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the proposed development is considered to be
      a scale that will cause minimal impacts, and therefore continued support is
      given on transport planning grounds. We trust the above is of assistance and
      please contact the undersigned should you have any queries or require any further
      information. \r\n\r\nYours faithfully, \r\nTraffix \r\nKedar Ballurkar Senior

      in a neat pile and stacked in a safe way. Unfortunately scavengers over night

      in Duncan St who placed their junk out weeks before the clean up, we complied
      with council's request and placed it out for collection 12 hours before collection.
      \r\n\r\nDon't defame us with your accusations calling us greedy and careless.
      The centre is now only for 24 children - a drop of 19 children - that is not
      a sign of greed that is compassion for our neighbouring residents- what is your
      compromise?\r\n\r\n If this proposal was 3 streets away from you Larry we never
      would hear from you, the simple fact is you just don't want it in your backyard.
      But reality is 100s of other maroubra residents,  many of them women and children
      are desperate for quality childcare for babies and they have signed a petition
      to that affect. I have operated 5 centres successfully and I left my role as

      . The DA that Council has recomended for approval is in the best interests of
      the Central ward and Maroubra as we Maroubra residents need to promote such
      small businesses and become a more family centric community."

      paper and billboard sale campaign highlights the house as a home: flowery sales
      pitch, glossy photos of styled rooms? No mention of it being able to be used
      as a business of any sort. Fancy landscaping, painted front wall, rooms filled
      with the latest in furniture, floorboards painted white. Not the sort of residence
      one would consider for a preschool nor buy then empty out to create a preschool.
      \r\n2 I use Duncan St every day and have done for over 25 years. The road is
      extremely narrow and we have had a side mirror on our car smashed a number of
      times as impatient drivers in big cars push through instead of pulling to the
      side when another car is driving in the opposite direction. \r\n3 To turn left
      OR right from Bond St to Duncan St is already hazardous and particularly so
      when a van or 4WD is parked close to either corner in Duncan St. \r\n\r\nImagine
      the chaos and the danger when 25 cars, which I assume will be a majority of
      large high bulky 4WD vehicles, congregate in the same timeframe morning and
      evening to drop off and pick up children. \r\n\r\n4 For the sake of the residents
      who live in houses and apartments adjoining and in Auditory range of this proposed
      preschool Centre, I trust the ludicrous proposal that this Centre be open to

    text: "Dear Councillors\r\nOur (the residents) objection to this DA is based on
      the site not being safe or suitable for a childcare centre.\r\nLet it be noted
      that the residents are not trying to sway Councillors by unjustified emotion,
      the issues of safety and traffic at this site have been ongoing and council
      is very much aware of the long standing problems at the junction of First Ave
      and Bond Street in which the proposed childcare centre is seeking approval and
      this matter cannot be ignored.Parking is a huge issue as rangers from Randwick
      council have attended this street over the past 12 months booking vehicles for
      parking illegally and blocking sight on all the adjoining streets and I believe
      that it has been proposed for NO STOPPING signs to go up and this matter will
      be presented to the traffic committee in June for approval, so if there is plenty
      of parking then why are cars parking illegally, these very much needed no stopping
      signs will also remove several parking spots in this street causing an additional
      problem in the street. \r\nI myself am just a mum and a local resident for all
      my life of 51 yrs and have offered over 10 years of volunteer community work
      7 days a week to local soccer clubs in the area but my credentials nor my portfolio
      should no be the reason why Councillors or council pay attention or be swayed
      to reject this DA. This site is not suitable for a childcare centre due to the
      safety of children and residents and the alterations to the parking situation
      will cause havoc, congestion and above all cause more safety issues for residents
      and visitors to this street. I and many others that have lived and support business
      in this Maroubra beach hub are very aware of the problems we have down here
      and this should not be ignored as there are much more suitable sites for childcare
      centres and this is not one of them.\r\nThanking you for your consideration\r\nMaria

    text: "Dear Residents and councillors,\r\nI am a parent of 2 and had a horrific
      time dropping my children into the city to attend childcare as that is the only
      location I could get for my children. I promised myself I would not just complain
      but do something about this so my husband and I saved, I restrained myself,
      got a job as Head of Operations for Moriah College and learnt how to operate
      5 childcare centres successfully. We then purchased a home around the corner
      from our own home and worked closely with the Council to develop a child care
      centre that was boutique and develop a business concept that could offers quality
      childcare to the community that serves organic food that is grown on site and
      teaches children about old fashion community living. \r\n\r\nMay I remind other
      residents of the positive comments some of you posted about child care centres
      being embedded in our local community:\r\n\r\n\"Posted by Lynette \r\nThe potential
      is huge for Yogiccubs Centre to:\r\n- offer their core business of childcare
      for an area in clear need \r\n- provide an easy transition for infant children
      to the nearby primary school at such a time as required \r\nEven though the
      above comment was in support of a childcare at the bowling club- our budget
      did not extend to over 20 million . As a passionate member of the community
      I lobbied to save the Bowlo attended meetings assisted local schools to try
      and purchase but unfortunately we were not successful)\r\nWhen Lyn wrote: \r\n\"
      If the Yogiccubs group really wanted to become a part of the community they
      would consider this option - it would actually show (not tell) support for the
      wishes and hopes for the community it proposes to become a part of.\"\r\nI would
      say in response that yogicubs is part of the maroubra community I am Yogicubs
      , I have been part of this community since I was 21, my husband and I moved
      here after completing law school. We have volunteered in the community and been
      part of this community and we deserve a say as well. We deserve to rely on the
      Council to assess the DA and they have. Rightfully they rejected the first DA
      and the second DA but the third is considerate of other residents and is fair.
      For a long time I was a member of the legal profession and justice is very important
      to me. I urge the 8 Councillors who voted in favour of the DA to do so again
      and not be swayed by unjustified emotion. The council have adjudicated the DA
      based on facts and the local planning instruments and have determined to support
      the DA we urge the coubncillors to do the same. \r\nMany thanks for your consideration

      to approve this DA at Tuesday, 9 May 2017, meeting.  Councillors Andrews, Stavrinos
      and Seng have lodged a recision motion to rescind the motion of approval.  These
      Councillors argued against the decision to approve the DA, and highlighted the
      real issues in Duncan Street and the adjoining streets:\r\n• The well-known
      dreadful parking situation here in Duncan Street • How the street is narrow,
      and presents a risk to drop off and pick up of children • The DA does not provide
      required onsite parking • The 2 x t intersections with First Avenue and Bond
      Street • Is not a suitable location for a childcare centre • And importantly,
      is not in the public interest.\r\n The recision motion to rescind the motion
      of approval means that Approval is on hold, and will be taken to another Council
      meeting in a week  giving us the residents one more opportunity to be heard,
      we believe that date is Tuesday, 23 May 2017.\r\nIt is vital that we let our
      neighbours know what happened at the meeting, and we have been advised to urge
      all concerned residents to:\r\n • lobby all Randwick Councillors to make clear
      our concerns with the DA • have a large turn up of concerned residents at the
      meeting so that all Councillors are aware of our objection to this Development
      Application. There were 4 residents at the meeting last Tuesday evening, it
      has been recommended that we need many more at the next meeting if we truly
      want our concerns noticed.\r\n If you are concerned and would like Councillors
      to hear your objection, please email or write to all Randwick Councillors, before
      23 May, expressing the reasons for your objection.  If you would like some more
      information, or assistance in getting an email or letter to the Councillors,

      million investment!!! the company and some cry. That's fine let Toll invest
      for sure but not at this site, start a fresh at Western Junction or, Rocherlea

      laterally and community minded. This approach would fit well with the current

    text: "Dear Councillor,\r\n\tAs neighbours in close proximity to the proposed
      development, we have major concerns.  Especially as our property has unimpeded
      direct views of the whole development and surrounding area. We already feel
      that our previous approaches to the Launceston City Council have fallen on deaf
      ears in regard to the existing problems that this company is causing.\r\n\r\nWe
      have found ourselves regularly being woken at all times of the night by reversing
      beepers from forklifts and extremely loud engine breaking from Tolls heavy vehicles.
      After contacting the council to inform them of these issues and enquire about
      noise regulations for the area we were told that they had “no idea” and would
      get back to us. Since then, we have been found out there is no possibility to
      complain about these problems as when we were contacted by Katherine Fitzgerald
      from the council she told us that there were “no such limits in place” for either
      operating hours, noise levels or nuisance lighting and that “perhaps that is
      the nature of their business”.\r\n\r\nWhy this individual business in particular
      is allowed to impact people at all hours of the day and night with whatever
      noise level they feel like producing is questionalble but what is most disturbing
      is that I’m certain that council is unaware of the extent of the current issues
      as the is no record of surrounding residences concerns or complaints.  The proposed
      development will only further compound these problems.\r\n\r\nCurrenlty, all
      other business activity within the same Light Industrial Zone is what I would
      consider reasonable, operating between 8am and 5pm.  This is not the current
      case for the Toll operations at Dowling Street.\r\n\r\n\tIn the limited review
      period given our own hectic schedules we have documented a few of our concerns
      with the development application submitted and it’s so called supporting documents
      obtained and downloaded from “https://onlineservice.launceston.tas.gov.au/eProperty/Publicnotices/305047/Advertised%20Plans%20-%2035%20Dowling%20Street,%20Launceston.pdf”\r\n\r\n1)\tThere
      has obviously been years of detailed planning by Toll with no consultation of
      the local residents, and we have only 2 weeks to review and analyse the impact
      of a 380 page submission. Neighbouring residences need to be properly informed
      and have a longer time period than only two weeks to review and comprehend such
      a major development.\r\n2)\tThe VIPAC site sound data was collected over the
      Christmas period which contained 3 public holidays.  This is not a representative
      study in our opinion.\r\n3)\tThe day-time and night-time representative impact
      sound recording by VIPAC on Cypress street was recorded 15 minutes apart, around
      6pm one afternoon and each representative sample only lasted 5 minutes in duration.
      \ Surely this should have been a continuous noise study to reveal the extent
      of the impact and it should have been located at one of the effected properties
      and not at a distance further from the site than the impacted neighbouring residences
      are.  Our property has a floor level 10m RL above the Toll facility, so there
      is an unobstructed noise path directly to a large portion of the house, including
      three bedrooms, the noise impact is not adequately represented by the VIPAC
      study.\r\n4)\tThe study by VIPAC has not included the noise generated by trains
      in the sound model. This is a major omission of the impact of the neighbourhood.\r\n5)\tWhat
      is the train operation schedule proposed by Toll and TasRail, what operational
      limits would be imposed given that site operations are listed as 24hrs.\r\n6)\tThe
      VIPAC study states that the reverse beepers are a specific and nuisance noise,
      so surely the optimisation of the site would have included relocating these
      operations so that noise is not towards the front boundary of the lot and included
      the use of sound barriers and other noise mitigation techniques.\r\n7)\tThe
      development application only considers the properties with in 100m of the proposed
      site. The distance from all areas of the Toll facility to the bedrooms of our
      property are between 150m to 500m. An Australian Acoustical Society study shows
      that both broadband and tonal reversing beepers are typically “Clearly Audible”
      to “Dominant” at 200m from operating machinery and seldom “Disappear” at ranges
      of 400m. When all members of family are woken during the night this clearly
      show that the sound is distinct, noticeable and loud (at all times). This makes
      the 100m distance used by the application appear quite inadequate.\r\n8)\tWarehouse
      storage in the application is increasing three-fold, but we are to rest assured
      that there will be no additional impact. This is somewhat hard to believe.\r\n9)\tThe
      application highlights the need to plant at least 82 trees at 10m tall to comply
      with the planning scheme yet only half the trees required have been proposed.
      These trees are sorely needed to soften the impact of the sound and lighting
      problems produce by Toll and its current operations, let alone when it expands.\r\n10)\tThere
      is not a definitive description by the developer in terms of their planned Day-time
      and Night-time activities, hours of truck and train arrivals, or any guarantee
      that this Major Transport Hub will not need to increase its operational activities
      to recover its investment.\r\n11)\tClosure of the Bell Bay storage will only
      reduce the Invermay heavy vehicle traffic.  All other Southbound heavy vehicle
      traffic is the same or increased.  Peak traffic for the staff from this facility
      will affect local traffic.\r\n12)\tGHD traffic count does not show the traffic
      at the Cimitere to Racecourse intersection where toll trucks often cut in front
      of traffic and hold up shoppers trying to access Kmart complex and local residents.
      This a major safety issue for vehicles and pedestrians using this intersection
      an area that is already very congested at most times of the day.\r\n13)\tIt
      is suggested that the removal of haulage from Bell Bay will result in less traffic,
      but provide no supporting evidence.  The percentage of operations of this haulage
      is not given in terms of the businesses total operations and is ambiguous at
      best.\r\n14)\tThe building plans clearly shows that the structures being proposed
      are higher than the 13.5m level specified in the application. This may need
      to be reviewed.\r\n15)\tThe VIPAC study show the assumption that all staff leave
      site by 6pm but then models forklifts operating overnight. \r\n16)\tThe proposal
      includes a new truck wash station and refilling station, currently these activities
      are conducted offsite.  Will fuel fumes and wash spray also effect nearby business
      and residents?\r\n17)\tTNT, TOLL, and several local freight companies are all
      located at the airport industrial complex including the Woolworths food distribution
      centre.  One has to ask why TOLL alone feels that the Boland St site is suitable
      for such a major transport hub, when others do not.\r\n18)\tWhile two copies
      of the folding light poles are included, there is no installation map of where
      these are to go and in particular no mention of the height proposed for these
      lights. The existing lighting configuration is already causing major light pollution
      to neighbouring residences.  With all curtains and blinds fully closed within
      our home there is still a bright ‘glow’ such that we don't need a night light
      and several of our security cameras do not switch to infrared night mode. Looking
      directly out any of the back windows of our house towards the Toll facility
      at night is blinding. It’s concerning that they are proposing to install more
      lights. Soon it will out shine the Aurora stadium!\r\n19)\tThe application proposes
      subdividing the existing lot into three separate lots, under the pretence that
      each subdivision could later be individually sold. However, this is somewhat
      deceptive as the division is clearly a distortion of the planning scheme as
      each lot individually requires 1-2 entrances, giving additional entry/exit points
      for the planned facility. \r\n20)\tPromises of reduced traffic are suggested
      however the installation of a four5 lane wide, 40m long waiting bay, does not
      provide confidence that this will be the case. Currently, trucks are not spilling
      onto public roads preventing passage, so why would an efficiency improvement
      of existing operations with no planned operational increase need such a design?\r\n21)\tThe
      GHD truck paths shown require trucks entering the facility to deviate into oncoming
      traffic to enter the site.  How is this an improvement in design!\r\n22)\tThe
      VIPAC noise analysis has specifically only shown noise modelling of the site
      based activities but ignores the impact of the 170 heavy vehicles per day driving
      along the residential streets. In the noise model their location is a stationary
      location within the boundary of the lot. This is not representative of what
      happens. Typically, vehicles of this size have noise levels of at least 55dB.
      The trucks are driving directly only meters from, or directly past residential
      properties, the Toll proposal does not limit this activity to day time only,
      so this would be a clear violation of the VIPAC suggested 40dB noise limit as
      they drive through our public streets during the night.\r\n23)\t40’ highlift
      container loaders normally operate at our nations wharves and heavy industrial
      complexes, not in a Light Industrial Area at the discretion of the local council.
      \ Transport and Storage facilities are only allowed within the light Industrial
      zone at the discretion of the council, thus this type of business is what I
      would consider a distorted use of a light industrial zoning.\r\n24)\tSince when
      does Light Industrial zoning become suitable for Heavy Industrial applications,
      such as the major transport hub that Toll is proposing? \r\n\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\tRebecca

      that nearby residents did not receive any notification of this, when a second
      storey  addition to a residential dwelling would merit adjacent land owners
      being advised. Shame on the Council for not doing this. Such an action brokers
      a lack of trust in our elected representatives. I only became aware of this
      proposal due to an eleventh hour letter box drop. \r\nI accept the lost of amenity
      from the rail yards as they existed before I built my property, and we have
      to tolerate Toll's constant noise from our property which is over one kilometre
      away, however as a city grows it is usual for industrial sites to be relocated
      - the exact opposite of what is being proposed. Not only should this proposal
      be refused, but it is also Council's responsibility to ensure that current noise
      and traffic movements have some degree of restriction.\r\nIf this proposal is
      given the green light, it will probably be nigh on impossible for this business
      to be relocated in my lifetime. We can perhaps, have little right to complain
      about what currently exists even though historically, change can see the location
      of a business as being no longer appropriate, but we most certainly have the
      right to ask for our Council to protect us from a further erosion of the amenity
      of our residential area.\r\n"

        My apologies for not responding to your text message however it was a public
        holiday and I was returning from a camping trip so am just clearing my messages
        now.\n\nWhen I met you on site last month I advised that Limberlost had been
        approached by Council to advise that they were operating outside of their
        approved guidelines and that they needed to submit a Development Application
        for consideration on their extended use. I said to you at the time that I
        would let you know when Council received the DA for consideration. This DA
        only came to my desk on Thursday afternoon so I haven't had a chance to check
        it out. \n\nI am very concerned about your comments about me turning a blind
        eye due to Ross Rankine making donations to Council, which I quite frankly
        know nothing about. As I said to you when we met at your place, the first
        time I met Ross Rankine and his partner was in a meeting at Limberlost that
        they asked me to attend approximately a month before I met you. I can assure
        you that I do not operate in the way you have suggested.\n\nI will be taking
        a look at the application in the next few days and catching up with the Planner
        to discuss further, however I'm more than happy to pop back out to see you
        and go through the application with you in its entirety. I can assure you
        that no-one is turning a blind eye but this is exactly the process that they
        are legally required to go through.\n\nKind regards,\n\nLinda\n\nCr Linda

        Hi Jim,

        This application is actually zoned for higher density (UR1) but the owner/ developer is creating individual house lots and doing extensive drainage and other  works to address the storm and tide overlays.

      Since moving here I have seen a surreal number of flats being built not in keeping

      and intergration of people that live in the area. Melbourne to me is no longer
      a livable city. I love living in this area but why is no one concerned in the
      government or local council about families, communities and brining people together.
      This is what this family orientated pub does. In addition why are we not protecting

        First, it is in a commercial zone, which allows a broad range of uses, and
        government has no tools at its disposal to direct that the site's use remain
        as a pub, let alone direct that it continue trading. The provisions of this
        zone were set by the State Government. Second, we do not have any planning
        tools to direct that the building be retained on heritage grounds; the Kensington
        Heritage review which was adopted only 3 years ago did not put this building
        in a heritage overlay. So the planning rules that Councillors are bound to
        uphold do support there being significant changes at this site. The scale,
        design and mix of uses of the proposal will need to be tested rigorously,

        Thanks Andrea,

        I haven't received the plans yet, so there is quite a way to go on this one. Thanks for your email, I agree that the overabundance of badly designed apartments is a significant problem in the inner suburbs. (By the way, the Racecourse development hasn't been approved yet; the Minister should not have let the podium-and-towers proposal proceed to planning panel stage, but hopefully he will see reason and send the VRC back to the drawing board.) As far as the Quiet Man is concerned - and it's my local so I understand its value to our community - while the zone certainly allows for apartment conversions, Council needs to push for a high quality outcome whatever is proposed. I'll certainly keep close tabs on the application and its progress.

        All the best,

    text: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI think it has now become ridiculous to be building apartments
      there. Despite it being on a main road, those cars will have to park on Burke
      Road (there is already limited parking due to the amount of apartments being
      built on the same section of the road), it will create a lot more congestion
      (as it is notorious it is one of the most congested roads in Melbourne), as
      the there is no regular public transport nearby, just one bus (the 548) and
      the tram (48), which in reality, most people do not elect to use, because of
      lack of tram lanes  (and priority). \r\n\r\nIn this area, people will have to
      become car dependent and due to being near the eastern freeway, why wouldn't
      they? This is just unnecessary. Including that all the overshadowing it will
      have on Stradbroke park. "

        Hello Bridget
        While I can understand your comments, I do not think this development is actually seeking to do these things.

        I believe that Council's preliminary assessment has determined that in fact there is no requirement for a reduction in parking  because the proposal meets the statutory requirement. The online register has been updated to reflect this.

        The application is quite limited in what it is seeking and is therefore classified as a VicSmart application.

    text: "I also oppose any reductions in car parking, especially in Union Road.
      It is already becoming a bottleneck. Wait until the Coles Supermarket is being
      built and operating!!!\r\nMy question is how come an existing building wants
      a reduction in car parking requirements, what are they? The application states
      \"(Vicsmart) Construction of buildings and works and reduction of the standard
      car parking requirement associated with an existing building\"\r\nAs usual there
      are no documents associated with the permit so far, so how can we realistically
      assess what the parking requirements are for the new building?\r\nBut in my
      experience the developer will get a sympathetic traffic report anyway and get
      through VCAT so I suggest that nothing can be done to fight it. A major factor
      is the laneway behind the shop, we need to know what is happening there as well."

        Hello Russell

        Having carried out a preliminary review of the application, Council has determined that the required number of car spaces associated with an office is going to be provided and thus no reduction in parking is being sought. The online register has been updated to reflect this.

        The application is now quite limited and is thus classified as a VicSmart application. This means that it is exempt from public notice requirements and third party appeal rights. Given the public notice exemption, plans will not be displayed online. These requirements and processes are not set by local government.

    text: Since the openings of ALDI and Bunnings this road has become very busy there
      are traffic lights on the Logan River Road intersection, but there are often
      accidents, and I believe at least on fatality. The other end of this street
      is High Road with No traffic lights not even a stop sign this intersection has
      become very dangerous as the view to the right of this intersection is often
      impaired by traffic parked on the side of the road. Also there is a retirement
      village on the High Road, directly opposite Glasson Drive however there is no
      pedestrian crossing available, hence it is very unsafe for the elderly to cross.
      As residents in this area who use these streets daily, I think you should consider
      a pedestrian crossing and a Stop sign at the High Road, Glasson Drive intersection.

      old trick by the developer, based on receiving massive opposition from nearby
      residents which will see the application rejected by the council. What follows
      is a scaled down resubmission, this one being eight stories with 16 two bedroom
      apartments,  the same height of neigbouring properties. Note 16 ratepayers as
      opposed to eleven.\r\n\r\nIt will happen, we are living in an economy that survives
      on real estate investment and the connected building boom that keeps this country
      out of recession. Not much else right now to fill the coffers so governments,
      local, state and federal are more than happy to approve such applications, especially
      in places such as Cranbrook Ave which is more or less ruined by such developments,

    text: 'I agree to the comments made by Penelope and Phil Horwood. The same problem
      exists in Pemberton St Oaklands Park. 3 two storey boxes were built at no 20
      and 21 where 1 house existed which was too small to accommodate 3 houses. I
      objected in the parking grounds as there was inadequate parking per council
      policy. This was ignored. Consequently these boxes were built with a single
      garage each that are so small that no car can get in there. A standard sedan
      is wider then the roller doors. As a result 5 to 6 vehicles are left parked
      on the narrow street on both sides of the road outside my premises. One vehicle
      was not moved until this tenant moved out. This has caused a danger to negotiate
      in and out of our driveway with vehicles parked opposite our driveway. This
      is compounded on busy Marion shopping days when shoppers use our street as an
      extension to the carpark with less then 20cm between parked cars on our street
      and cars parked in the T junction and less then a metre from a corner. Requests
      to have no parking signs opposite our driveway to council were denied. We were
      told to widen our drive to prevent the parking problem??? When we advised council
      this wasn''t possible as a stobbie pole was on the edge of our drive the council
      have ignored my emails which were supported by photograph evidence. It is time
      the council took the areas planning serious in relation to the car parking problem
      on residential areas they are creating by allowing ridiculous over development
      and ignoring objections about street parking. Does something serious have to
      happen to a pedestrian as a result if this hazard they are creating before they
      take notice. Further where are we mean''t to put our council bins on bin night
      when the front of our residence is full of parked cars. My bin has been missed
      for this reason and council still do nothing about this. '

      a child care centre is to be located on a site adjoining a residential property,
      noise generated by the centre must not be more than 5dB(A) above the ambient
      (L90) background noise level, as measured at any point on the adjoining residential
      property.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again, table 3-7, page 19 shows the predicted ambient
      noise at the eastern outdoor play area is 36dB(A). This would be all houses
      in R5 (all houses on Livingstone avenue), plus 4 Yarrara road that is on the
      battle axe. Also, R4 and R3 houses will receive significantly more abient noise
      that the +5dB(A).\r\n\r\nThe noise criterion for any houses along the eastern
      boundary should be 36dB(A) + 5db(A) = 41dB(A).\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\nWhen
      I questioned these numbers, it was not up for debate and has been assessed.\r\n\r\nI
      was told that if we are not happy, we would have to get our noise report and
      take it to the Land and Environment Court.\r\n\r\nGiven that the development
      is going to generate significant noise and the report is been written up to
      be most favourable to the applicant, then we are stuck on our own. \r\n46dbA
      average ambient noise, with peaks for over 100dBA is not pleasant.\r\n\r\nWe
      need to get our own ambient noise report, as the existing one is biased and
      written to deceive readers.\r\n\r\nThey couldn't tell me who/what I need contact
      in council to make ongoing EPA noise breaches. They said I would need my own
      noise monitoring equipment (these cost $6000 each) or pay for my own consultants
      to come in and write up a report ($1600).  Then take my new report to the land
      and environment court and challenge both the council and the developer.\r\n\r\nI
      called council and asked for the department that looks after noise complaints.
      \r\nWas told by Anne that there is no department that looks after this and there
      is no way of controlling noise from kids... If you move next to a school, expect
      noise. Except I didn't move next to a school, it was built without any effective
      way of controlling the environment....\r\n\r\nThis doesn't feel that it's a
      system that protects individuals or their own property/environment."

        Hi Peter,

        Thank you for raising your concerns.

        Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you view it. Development is governed by the Planning Scheme and up until last month by the Caboolture Planning Scheme

        This is the controls put in place for developers and incorporates the criteria as far as conservation they need to confirm to.

        Again, thank you for raising your concerns.

    text: "I wish to oppose the demolition of 38 Arthur Street, East Launceston.\r\n\r\nThe
      supporting documention with the application asserts this place was built c1930.
      The core of the building suggests an 1850s/60s residence, with a c1900 addition
      to the western section of the building. Archival records support this. This
      would make this building an early timber building in East Launceston. Have the
      applicants considered re-use of this clearly early building? The internal fittings
      support the early nature of this building.\r\n\r\nThe supporting documentation
      also neglects to assess the heritage values of the place, and loss of streetscape
      to the area. Was this place considered in the Paul Davies Launceston Heritage
      Study? Is it a recommendation in the state, local or precinct reports of the
      heritage study? When will these reports be made public to ratepayers? All other
      municipal council surveys are found on council websites. Why hasn't Launceston
      done this?\r\n\r\nFor almost six decades this place was home to the Burgess
      family. QG Burgess was a well-known commercial traveller and employee of the
      Mercury newspaper. He was active in the Launceston church and commercial circles.
      His wife was a prominent northern Tasmanian philanthropist. At the time of her
      death she left substantial funds to nine charities. 38 Arthur Street was a social
      hub, where fundraising for these charities took place. The application to demolish
      does not take into account these associative and community values, which are
      key indicators of heritage status.\r\n\r\nLastly, will the adjacent intersection
      be affected by increased traffic to this venue? Vision at the intersection is
      poor and there is a lack of parking for local residents which is taken up by
      customers to surrounding businesses. This will likely increase with the proposed
      addition to the premises. Will it operate outside of normal business hours?\r\n\r\nI
      acknowledge the contribution this small business makes to the area. I also know
      the owners have respect for heritage buildings, having restored one themselves.

    text: 'I have lived in North Balwyn for over 50 years, but my beautiful North
      Balwyn is rapidly changing, and not for good. There are ugly, huge McMansions
      popping up in every single street. They are replacing lovely old homes with
      character which were built after the war, and ripping out old established gardens
      contributing to loss of homes for numerous birds, possums, and other wildlife.
      The North Balwyn of old has gone and sadly will never be the same. Most new
      developments are built from fence line to fence line and seem to be designed
      and built rapidly, with little or no thought to natural shade (most requiring
      costly air conditioning systems) or beauty, and most would better suit the French
      or Italian countryside, not suburban melbourne. Being very large, some new developments
      overshadow houses on either side, and lack the large treed gardens of previous
      homes, as developers just demolish both existing house and garden. When is this
      inappropriate development going to stop? When there are no old houses left?
      That will be a sad day indeed. We should be maintaining our history not bulldozing
      It! '

        Hello Lynn,

        Thanks for your email and I share your concerns. However you are asking the impossible. The 2006 Planning scheme, long before I was interested in politics, enabled the subdivisions. That scheme is still in place. I would also suggest that the next planning scheme due to be delivered this year, requires the State Ministers agreement and I don’t see any desire to change the ability of land to be reduced to an average of 400 square metres. My personal position is that significant change needs to be applied where the Council is not instructed by the State. Either the Council makes the decisions based on a COMMUNITY  planning scheme or the State take over the Councils role and makes the approvals based on their SEQ planning scheme.

        Regards,


        Mark

        Hi Daniel,
        Thanks for your email. The design that Council is working on approving for Civic Square includes additional trees as well as replacements for the trees to be removed. The trees to be removed from outside the library would be harmed by the activity, so they will be taken out and planted elsewhere in the city to ensure their survival, and the three spotted gums outside Henty House are a threat to infrastructure and will be taken out. These three trees are planned to be replaced with seven gums, planted in root guards so that the problem doesn't occur again. The trees taken from the library will be replaced with more trees than will be removed. I had heard someone in the public say that the myrtles were to be removed, but this is certainly not the case.
        I would encourage you to contact council staff to have a chat about the details, but be assured that Council have already had this conversation.
        Kind regards
        Emma Williams

      my daughter we find it an enjoyable and amenable area. \r\nWe look forward to
      the area being updated and it's changed use that will make it a more enjoyable.
      \r\nI wish to make a representation against the removal of mature trees. Despite
      an artist's impression showing the retention of the gumtrees on the north east
      corner of Henty House, in the plan the trees are to be removed. \r\nThe trees
      are healthy and shade giving, softening the brutalist design of the  monolithic
      Henty House. \r\nWhilst I understand the plan wanting to update the infrastructure
      and paving,  I strongly resent that shade giving and mature plants are to be
      removed. \r\nThe trees on the left, front east area  around the library entrance
      and the trees on the north east area of St Andrews Church are all slated to
      be removed.  Trees which have all matured beautifully over many years. It is
      difficult to comment on the proposed design by Aspect Studios of Adelaide due
      to the convoluted and poor documents that are very difficult to read for a lay
      person as they are so complicated with many overlays of different colours and
      ideas. \r\nMy objection to this plan is that perfectly good seating, gardens
      and much-loved areas are also being  removed and it's difficult to see what's
      being replaced. \r\n I look forward to the public  having further consultations
      \ so that we can have a better idea of what our beloved Civic square will look
      like in the future if the plan is continued with. "

    text: "Hi Tim,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you in regard to the proposed development
      of 35 Saltair Street. As a property owner in the nearby vicinity, and after
      easing the prior emails you have had sent to you, I have a number of concerns
      which I feel as a valued member of the Sunshine Coast community need to be expressed.
      A number of these issues seem to have been raised in prior correspondence, with
      yourself and the local community but it seems to me that your response, some
      of which are I feel are words that might not be of your own wording and rather
      put together by others, for you.\r\n\r\nThe first of which I would like to put
      forward to you is that the residents of Kings Beach, and by no means am I speaking
      for all, but I feel would completely disagree with your response about Kings
      Beach roads taking the capacity / load of traffic in the area. Tim I not sure
      exactly what your strategic team is up to, but I can tell you they must have
      the wrong information or really they are sitting in a different location and
      thinking they are in Kings beach!!! Tim I'll be the first to say I Iove the
      area and what it's history is and the fact that it's one of the sunshine coast
      best holiday spots, but if you and or your strategic planning team feel the
      network of roads and parking are capable of with standing the capacity of traffic
      then I feel our council is not completing their tasks as elected members to
      represent our community. You're more then welcome to throw as many of your strategic
      planning facts and figures at me, but i'll let you in on somewhat of a little
      secret, the parking in our great area is a disgrace, and thats before we even
      get to everyone's favourite time, holiday time. I can't tell you, your little
      team of elected members of our community, and the strategic planning team how
      incorrect you are. I ask you to grab your hat and sunscreen and walk the walk
      around the area and see it for yourself. Now knowing what I know, from my background
      I'm going to say that the developer will come to some agreement to accommodate
      those extra cars so that they aren't parked on Saltair Street however, it comes
      to my attention that you may also need to factor in the visitors and family
      that will also come with these new units owners. Where do you feel they will
      park their cars? There is only so much room for them onsite, there is already
      no parking signs in the street. Which at 35 units in the development, and if
      one unit has a guest each over at the same time, which is probable, where do
      they park their cars? I mean sure, everyone loves exercise but do you feel people
      would be happy parking so far away? Better still, if I was going to buy one
      of these units, I'd be asking where all the street parking is, no parking, no
      deal. Now some people might be happy with that, and I respect that, but there
      are a lot of people who won't be happy with that, like the residents who already
      live in the connecting streets. I feel your responses thus far have been, at
      best average. Take a good hard look through the Kings Beach area, there is lack
      of packing considering the amount or dewellings that are in the area. Then at
      holiday time it just becomes even worse. Now you could say to me, well you did
      make the choice to live in the area, and yes you're right. That was based on
      many reasons but one of the reasons I choose this location to purchase was because
      it wasn't looking like the gold coast where everyone seems to be living more
      and more like they are in a tin of sardines. The space, the fact we have minimal
      high-rise. I actually think that makes us more of a desired location for families
      on holidays because we are mrs of a community then a holiday precinct. I mean
      of all streets to choose to put another development, a cul-de-sac??? This actually
      leads me to my next point which is, surely the has to be some other street or
      even a suburb that these developments could be approved? Maybe even an area
      that is untapped, or even on a bigger through road....??? The Street is already
      under enough stress as it is. It's clear to even see that with the trucks that
      cut through the street, but I'm guessing the strategic planning team doesn't
      really see the trucks from their point of view, not too mention the rest of
      the traffic, which for a dead end street is more then I've ever seen. I mean
      let's just think about the traffic that will take place on this street and the
      joining streets over the duration of the build. The first of which will be a
      demolition team, probably consisting of a number of large earth moving equipment.
      That to me, and Im no expert, I'm just simply raising the obvious, is going
      to be a little more then the normal road traffic in Saltair Street and adjoining
      streets. next will come the piling gear, which will be heavier again. This will
      be followed by the commencement of slabs for the structure. Now if I do a rough
      figure in my head, I'm going to say there will be a fair area of floor space
      per floor. I'm going to guess roughly 700m2, which means one thing. The transport
      of materials to site on large trucks will be of excessive weights. On decks
      that size you will average steel truck delivery's around the maximum weight
      load of 24 tonne and I'll guess again and say that nearly all slabs bar the
      podium deck will take roughly 30 tonne each. The podium deck, which is the first
      deck of a build will take a lot more, possibly double that due to post tensioning
      of the podium slab. This creating more weight on such little streets, has your
      strategic planning team thought about all these weights? I'm really hoping they
      have, because after that comes the concrete trucks which at a guess will carry
      around 7 cubic metres each is going to be around 17.2 tonne each, plus the tare
      weight of the truck which will be around another 12 tonne. I'm sure I could
      go on Tim, but I feel by now you must be getting the picture about the roads
      around Kings beach taking this extra traffic, weight and size. That is of course
      if the truck drivers can actually gain access into the street with it being
      so narrow, I know for one i wouldn't want to be backing a semi trailer with
      24 tonne of rep steel bar on it, all the way up Saltair Street. I'm sure that
      the council along with residents in our community wouldn't want that either?
      Because let's face it, the street and adjoining streets are nowhere near big
      enough to take the size and weight or this traffic. My opinion at the end of
      the day is that the streets will not handle it. Sure, Tomkins are doing a development
      in Canberra Terrace but the line of concrete trucks doesn't appeal to me there
      either, however it's a much wider and larger road that has better access points
      for large gear, wide trucks and ore traffic in general.\r\n\r\nThe next issue
      I feel needs to be looked at seriously is that of people's privacy. Now I know
      that with living in a unit privacy is of a premium. It's something that you
      relinquish by buying a unit. Especially when you have other units so close,
      that I can sit on the toilet and other people can watch me. Yes we all have
      doors and windows, and yes we can keep them closed for more privacy, however
      we also have a choice, and a right to live how we like, respectfully that is.
      Whether you live on the top or bottom floor of any unit with other units close
      by, people are always going to be having a look in. That's what us as humans
      do, we sticky beak and want to know what everyone is up to. I think it's called
      something like neighbourhood watch? You know, where we are encouraged to look
      out for any suspect behaviour and in general look out for each other. Now as
      a good community member I am happy to do such things, what most people aren't
      happy with is people seeing in every time they open a door or a window. Too
      be completely honest it's almost invasion of privacy. Now take yourself out
      of your shoes for a moment and put yourself in the unit owners shoes or better
      still the new buyers shoes, do you feel that's something that a development
      like this is going to be able to provide privacy for all parties, including
      keeping your doors and windows open? Look what I'm getting at is that the location
      of this particular development seems rather odd, that is on top of my other
      comments and valid points. I mean, if a tower crane happens to be erected for
      the site, which is a probable possibility, where do we sit with privacy? Not
      too mention the boom over hang, unless of course they are planning to use a
      jib luffing crane? Or should the developer chose not to use a tower crane, where
      on earth can they set up a mobile crane in that street for hours at a time?
      Can that crane hold the capacity of a 50 to 100 tonne mobile crane? That just
      comes back to the traffic, but i'm guessing your elite strategic team would
      know all these little things that need to be factored in for each project, all
      the gross mass weights of the machinery , trucks and materials being delivered
      to site, and even the materials, not to mention a site like that is going to
      need to army of trees to complete it, where do you feel they will all park for
      the duration of the project? That's a lot of traffic Tim, and what happens to
      the damage of the roads? We all know that council will put it back on the developer.
      The developer will put it back to the council, this will go on for a number
      of weeks maybe even months and with no action. You can sit there and respond
      with what ever you feel is right in response, and no disrespect, but you sit
      in an office wearing a white collar not a blue collar. Sometimes us blue collars
      are handy to know a thing or two and think outside the normal box most look
      into.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day let's face it, this is going to be a business
      deal between the council and developers. The way I see it, more rates bills
      to be paid more water bills, more power bills, but is this development right
      for this location? My answer is no, and that's just based on the traffic system
      let along the extra people, or the loss of people's views, which I didn't even
      touch on. Tim if you and your team feel that this is the ideal development for
      this area, then maybe you might need to look on seek.com.au. because as a member
      of our community I feel that council and all the people that have been elected
      to stand and represent our community aren't doing the tasks and seeing their
      promises for which they have been voted in for, in our community. I don't know
      all the fancy rules and regulations like others do in our area, but one thing
      I do know is that we, as a community don''t need another development in a street
      that really can't take anymore.\r\n\r\nKind Regards, \r\nJoel\r\n"

    text: Hi. This morning a very large delivery truck arrived with scaffolding for
      this development. The truck blocked the cul-de-sac while the driver unpacked
      the equipment on to the footpath in front of the site. It was garbage pickup
      day which added to the problem. I have rung the Sunshine Coast Council as I
      am concerned that this scaffolding is going to remain on the footpath for a
      long period of time. I have been told that someone will come out and look at
      the situation and also it will be investigated if the developer has a permit
      to place equipment on the footpath. I would like to know the result of this
      call and how long the permit would be for. I think that this morning's actions
      are a good indicator of what to expect in the near future.

      go on Tim, but I feel by now you must be getting the picture about the roads
      around Kings beach taking this extra traffic, weight and size. That is of course
      if the truck drivers can actually gain access into the street with it being
      so narrow, I know for one i wouldn't want to be backing a semi trailer with
      24 tonne of rep steel bar on it, all the way up Saltair Street. I'm sure that
      the council along with residents in our community wouldn't want that either?
      Because let's face it, the street and adjoining streets are nowhere near big
      enough to take the size and weight or this traffic. My opinion at the end of
      the day is that the streets will not handle it. Sure, Tomkins are doing a development
      in Canberra Terrace but the line of concrete trucks doesn't appeal to me there
      either, however it's a much wider and larger road that has better access points
      for large gear, wide trucks and ore traffic in general.\r\n\r\nThe next issue
      I feel needs to be looked at seriously is that of people's privacy. Now I know
      that with living in a unit privacy is of a premium. It's something that you
      relinquish by buying a unit. Especially when you have other units so close,
      that I can sit on the toilet and other people can watch me. Yes we all have
      doors and windows, and yes we can keep them closed for more privacy, however
      we also have a choice, and a right to live how we like, respectfully that is.
      Whether you live on the top or bottom floor of any unit with other units close
      by, people are always going to be having a look in. That's what us as humans
      do, we sticky beak and want to know what everyone is up to. I think it's called
      something like neighbourhood watch? You know, where we are encouraged to look
      out for any suspect behaviour and in general look out for each other. Now as
      a good community member I am happy to do such things, what most people aren't
      happy with is people seeing in every time they open a door or a window. Too
      be completely honest it's almost invasion of privacy. Now take yourself out
      of your shoes for a moment and put yourself in the unit owners shoes or better
      still the new buyers shoes, do you feel that's something that a development
      like this is going to be able to provide privacy for all parties, including
      keeping your doors and windows open? Look what I'm getting at is that the location
      of this particular development seems rather odd, that is on top of my other
      comments and valid points. I mean, if a tower crane happens to be erected for
      the site, which is a probable possibility, where do we sit with privacy? Not
      too mention the boom over hang, unless of course they are planning to use a
      jib luffing crane? Or should the developer chose not to use a tower crane, where
      on earth can they set up a mobile crane in that street for hours at a time?
      Can that crane hold the capacity of a 50 to 100 tonne mobile crane? That just
      comes back to the traffic, but i'm guessing your elite strategic team would
      know all these little things that need to be factored in for each project, all
      the gross mass weights of the machinery , trucks and materials being delivered
      to site, and even the materials, not to mention a site like that is going to
      need to army of trees to complete it, where do you feel they will all park for
      the duration of the project? That's a lot of traffic Tim, and what happens to
      the damage of the roads? We all know that council will put it back on the developer.
      The developer will put it back to the council, this will go on for a number
      of weeks maybe even months and with no action. You can sit there and respond
      with what ever you feel is right in response, and no disrespect, but you sit
      in an office wearing a white collar not a blue collar. Sometimes us blue collars
      are handy to know a thing or two and think outside the normal box most look
      into.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day let's face it, this is going to be a business
      deal between the council and developers. The way I see it, more rates bills
      to be paid more water bills, more power bills, but is this development right
      for this location? My answer is no, and that's just based on the traffic system
      let along the extra people, or the loss of people's views, which I didn't even
      touch on. Tim if you and your team feel that this is the ideal development for
      this area, then maybe you might need to look on seek.com.au. because as a member
      of our community I feel that council and all the people that have been elected
      to stand and represent our community aren't doing the tasks and seeing their
      promises for which they have been voted in for, in our community. I don't know
      all the fancy rules and regulations like others do in our area, but one thing
      I do know is that we, as a community don''t need another development in a street
      that really can't take anymore.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nJoel\r\n\r\n"

      your reference to the planning scheme. Can you be specific about how this relates
      to our issue of the narrowness of Saltair Street at the cul de sac end to the
      proposed number of apartments in this complex. As with other complainants in
      the email trail we are concerned that the amenity of the current residents will
      be adversely affected. In our case this would be due to the large complex proposed
      for such a small cul de sac. Surely in terms of the traffic assessment council
      must consider that some streets must reach a traffic saturation point?"

      text: "Dear Brian and Diane,\n                                The Planning Scheme
        designation has a direct relationship with the \"intensity of use\" in the
        street. So being a High Density Residential Zone(HDRZ) means that; parking
        requirements, traffic flows, pedestrian flows etc will be in bigger numbers
        and intensity than low density areas.\nIn regard to the consultation done
        for any Planning Scheme, whether here or other parts of Qld, that is where
        local governments get feedback from the community in regard to proposals in
        the Scheme as you would be aware. The HDRZ for Saltair St and other streets
        in the area have not received opposition, of any significance if at all, as
        a result of consultation done for the Sunshine Coast Planning and prior to
        that the Caloundra City Planning Scheme. \n\n Council officers consider the
        local characteristics of the area when assessing all applications. In regard
        to your comment about the street, presently there are a certain number of
        cars that can park 'on street'. This will not change with any further development
        so the function of the street won't change, however the number of cars using
        the street is where change will occur. However with the HDRZ designation,
        this was always going to be the case. \nSo council officers will consider
        the carrying capacity of the street as they do with all applications. When
        the Scheme was developed the carrying capacity of the road networks were considered.
        Council's strategic planners see the streets of Kings Beach as suitable for
        high density living and capable of managing the volume of cars. Yes, roads
        will get busier as development potential is realised, but the local road network
        of Kings Beach has the capacity to carry the load.\nIt's the main thoroughfares
        in and out of Caloundra that require improvements to carrying capacity. That
        is why the recently released Caloundra Centre Master Plan included road network
        improvements that address growth. \n\nShould you wish to discuss this matter
        further please call my office on 54208965. Thank you Brian and Diane. Tim.\n\n\n

    text: "Good Morning Tim\r\n\r\nWe live in the building 32-34 Saltair Street, Kings
      Beach and we would like to make a comment on the proposed application for 33
      Saltair Street, Kings Beach (MCU16/0258).\r\n\r\nOur building is situated in
      a small cul de sac which does not have any street parking. Council have erected
      “no parking” signs.\r\n\r\nOur belief is that if this large building is erected
      the cul de sac and adjacent street will not be able to cope with the large number
      of resident’s car and visitor’s cars that will park in this street already crowded
      with cars. Saltair Street is a narrow street so more traffic will make the road
      more dangerous. Most residents walk on the road to the beach as there are no
      contiguous concreted footpaths on either side of Saltair Street and the footpath
      is very uneven. It is impossible to push a stroller on the footpaths.\r\n\r\nThe
      residents of our building will also have difficulty in accessing the building
      if more cars park in the cul de sac. Over the Christmas period cars have parked
      illegally in the cul de sac and we have not seen any presence of council setting
      fines for these misdemeanours. The garbage truck and service vehicles to our
      building will have difficulty with more cars parked on Saltair Street.\r\n\r\nIt
      is our belief that this proposal will impact on the quality of life of many
      of the residents in our building and in Saltair street due to the inevitable
      increase in traffic and on street parking in the immediate area of the cul de
      sac. \r\n\r\nWe are suggesting that Council request that the developer seeks
      access to this development via the vacant land fronting to Verney street which
      is immediately behind this proposed development.\r\n\r\n"

        Dear Donald,
                              You will note that my comment was "guarantee a view by being absolute beachfront".
        Please note there are many, many residents that are not wealthy, nor beachfront, but do have ocean views. However when not absolute beachfront those many, many people might reasonably conclude that their view is not guaranteed for life.
        Council is cognisant of view lines, amongst other things, when considering planning matters and settlement patterns.
        Thank you Donald. Tim.

        Dear Mike,
                           I can certainly help organise a discussion between yourself and a senior officer from the Planning Department.
        The officer can work through the process they follow when considering all the relevant matters, for example, bulk and scale(relates to setbacks-front/side/rear, site cover).
         In regard to the word "unreasonable", the officer will provide the context of it's use in the Scheme as it relates to the various levels of assessment.(Exempt/Self Assessable/Code Assessable/Impact Assessable). The officer will also be able to give guidance on how different sections of the Scheme must be read in a 'collaborative manner' to provide a full comprehension of the Scheme's intent for a specific location/planning zone.
        Many people rely on advice from a real estate agent as part of their due diligence for the purchase of a property. This advice should always be balanced by engaging a planning professional and/or a planning officer from the relevant local government.

        Please call my office on 54208965 when you're ready and speak with Sharon or I to get something sorted out.

        Thanks Mike. Tim.

      absolutely nothing. The council are obviously only interested in  the BIG developers,
      not the small people trying to enjoy life on the Sunshine Coast. \r\nI purchased
      my property as an investment to help me in my approaching retirement years.
      I couldn't afford to buy in a brand new development,so l purchased an older
      apartment and yes it's on the top floor and yes it's on one of the highest points
      in Kings Beach, but that's not going to stop me losing my entire view if this
      development goes ahead in it's current form. The only view l will have is that
      of a big cement building, and that goes for all the apartments in \"The Cascades\"\r\nObviously
      development has to happen, but all l ask is for some consideration by the council
      and the councillors to people who already live or own properties on the Sunshine

      text: "Dear Mike,\n               Thank you for your email. I have done a basic
        search on the 35 Saltair St application as the officer responsible for the
        assessment is away until next week.\n*Saltair St falls within the \"High Density
        Residential Zone\"(HDRZ) in the Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme.\n*The application
        is \"Code Assessable\" as the applicant has not applied for any development
        rights outside of the planning code for the location that would elevate the
        application to a more stringent level of assessment.\n*As it is a Code Assessable
        application there are no formal 3rd party submissions that can be formally
        lodged in regard to the application. \n*The application is currently at the
        \"Information Request\" stage as officers need further information from the
        applicant to enable them to properly assess the application.\n*The height
        limit for the location is 21M, as is the case for the rest of Saltair St.
        There are also setback requirements from each boundary as set out in the Planning
        Scheme Codes for this HDRZ. These requirements along with site cover are used
        to determine appropriate bulk and scale of a development.\n\nIn regard to
        your question, \"development ensures that there is no unreasonable loss of
        amenity for surrounding premises  ...\", I would think that if the application
        meets the intent of the scheme and is in general accord with the relevant
        Codes, then it would be hard to mount a legal argument that the proposed development
        is unreasonable. \nBy that I mean any reasonable person would have to acknowledge
        that a development that aligns with the Planning Scheme should be expected,
        hence not a surprise. \nUsing scenic amenity(view lines) as an example, the
        only way to ensure a person would not lose their view would be to buy an absolute
        beachfront property, where no other development could build you out. Or you
        might buy the top floor unit in a development located on the town's highest
        point.\nI believe the subject address currently has a house on it, so it would
        be obvious to anyone that has made themselves aware of the Planning Scheme
        and had done their due diligence, that a building of up to 21M will impact
        on surrounding properties.\nUsing history as an example, when the first multi-unit
        complex was constructed in/around the subject address, it no doubt impacted
        on surrounding properties. So it goes that each time there is subsequent development
        there will be further impact to adjacent properties. \nFrom the experience
        I've gained as a councillor over the past 16 years, it would probably be deemed
        unreasonable for a person to object to a Code Assessable development generally
        compliant with the Scheme, when the objector is living in a development that
        followed a similar development path. In saying that, I certainly respect the
        right of any person to voice their opinion, whether that be an objection or
        support.\nPrivacy and overlooking are also considered by the assessing officer,
        however when considering development in HDRZ's there is no way to avoid seeing
        the development next door. Council officers work with an applicant to ensure
        the placement/location of balconies, privacy screens, floor plans and apartment
        configurations, and other relevant elements are designed to respond to the
        characteristics of neighbouring development. \n\nIn response to you final
        question below, it is usually only where an application is \"Impact Assessable\"
        rather than \"Code Assessable\" where objectors have the ability to stop,
        delay or hold back development. So whilst Mr Lindsay, whom you mention below,
        has emailed his concern/objection , the council officer assessing the application
        does not have a responsibility under the State Govt's Planning Act to give
        any formal consideration to it. The officer must respond to the development
        codes and intent of the Scheme when doing the assessment and this in itself
        is the way that the concerns raised by Mr Lindsay will be addressed to the
        extent possible under the Planning Scheme.\n\nMike, I will send this email
        to the council officer responsible for the assessment and allow her to make
        any corrections to the information \tI have provided above. Should you need
        me to provide further information or clarify anything, please let me know.
        At this time I have not read the 35 Saltair application as it is still at
        the Information Request stage, so my comments above are about the principles
        of planning for the street, rather than any judgement.\n\nThanks again Mike.

      \ We now have wrong mail delivered, and now pending approval for construction

      1c,1b & so on are being confused with ours. What does the council now propose

      text: "Dear Richard,\n\nThanks for your email. Sorry for my delay, I've just
        been confirming some items you referred to..\n\nThe proposal you refer to
        is indeed a planning application to the Planning Minister, so the gross floor
        area must exceed 25,000sqm. Despite that, the City of Melbourne will be asked
        its views, and this will include a public, open Future Melbourne Committee
        meeting to consider our officers’ assessment of the application.\n\nThe four
        storey height control you mention is discretionary, and that is a major contributor
        to planning uncertainty in West Melbourne at the moment. Four storeys discretionary
        no longer means four or five or six storeys; it often means significantly
        more than that. A big catalyst for this has been Matthew Guy’s years as Planning
        Minister. With so many examples of built form that exceeds the discretionary
        heights, it is now becoming very difficult for Council to negotiate or approve
        well-designed buildings that integrate well with the prevailing neighbourhood
        character and meet community expectations. The current controls are out of
        date and are no longer fit for purpose, and that’s why Government has looked
        at different sorts of controls in other parts of the City of Melbourne in
        recent years, such as in Arden Macaulay (with a preferred-maximum and mandatory-maximum
        heights regime) and the Central City (with its density thresholds, above which
        clearly defined public benefits must be provided).\n\nA new West Melbourne
        Structure Plan is due to be adopted this year, and it will set the direction
        for changes to the planning scheme including the built form controls. I hope
        you got to the session about this last weekend, I unfortunately was busy at
        another Council event but I understand the room was packed! If you haven't
        added your voice , please do so before the Structure Plan is drafted for public

    text: "I am disappointed that the application has been resubmitted, seemingly
      without any notice having been taken to the objections to the previous submission.
      \r\n\r\nThis area is quiet, and aesthetically pleasing, with older and renovated
      homes. It has plenty of greenery, which is proven to have a positive effect
      on mood and health of people living in such areas. I object to high density
      construction. It is visually obstructive, reduces aesthetic appeal of the neighbourhood,
      increases noise and traffic, encourages transient tenants, noise disturbances
      and neighbourhood disputes. \r\n\r\nI believe this site development may decrease
      stability of the land surrounding it, and increase the existing drainage issues.
      \r\nMy property has shown evidence of significant movement, with large cracks
      opening up in plaster in several rooms, and uneven, visible cracks in the exterior
      brickwork and cement. There is a two to three inch separation between a large
      cement area and a cement staircase to the rear of my property that has only
      occurred in December 2016. This area is on the slope which runs toward the proposed
      building site. I can provide photo evidence to prove this if required. \r\n\r\nI
      purchased this property because it was in a quiet residential area, as I despise
      high density living, and wished to bring my children up in a peaceful area conducive
      to family living. The flats below us had undesirable tenants recently, and there
      have been builders there repairing extensive damage to this flat for several
      weeks now. I believe that more high density living will increase such issues.
      The noise and violence was very distressing for my children and myself. \r\nI
      do not want to have a large building looking down into our back yard. Due to
      the significant slope, I will not be able to in any way construct a fence to
      give the privacy we currently have if the application and construction goes
      ahead. I would never have chosen to purchase this property if I'd been advised
      that it would back onto high density living. \r\n\r\nI believe the development
      is highly unsuitable to this neighbourhood, and will disrupt our peaceful neighbourhoods
      aesthetics and community. It will increase noise levels, damage our current
      good traffic flow and obstruct drainage. I firmly believe that the impact of
      construction will likely further destabilise the ground stability and cause
      structural issues to worsen and affect more surrounding properties. \r\n\r\n"

      am saddened that the historic significance of the building has been neglected,
      as it is part of creating the quaint beauty of Bondi Beach and especially the
      flavour of Sir Thomas Mitchell Road.\r\nAs the new immediate neighbour to the
      building at 54 Campbell Parade, I walked around the building today and noticed
      it's unique shape and how the street is enhanced by it's unique beauty.\r\nI
      emphasised the lack of light as my immediate concern in my previous comment,
      but after my shock at hearing the proposal, I now also realise having two floors
      added would take away all my valued privacy. As a studio owner/resident, I only
      have a small space. My bedroom/living room would be in full view of the two
      new upper floor apartments unless I keep blinds down at all times. My now private
      balcony, which I treasure as living space, would lose all it's privacy too,
      and I would lose the enjoyment I now have using it. I am very distressed by
      this. The home-like and airy, light feeling of my small unit will be lost and
      I will feel boxed in if the height of the building is pushed up another two
      floors.\r\nThank you."

        Hello Russell

        Thanks for your feedback.  I will forward your concerns onto the officer assessing the application.

        While I agree with you that the area does not need another bottle shop, the questions of need, competition or financial viability are not factors that can be used to guide Council in assessing an application.   As strange as this may sound, there is a long list of Tribunal decisions that state that Council must assess every application on its merits despite the existence of other similar uses nearby.

        Also Council is unable to choose which application it receives.  Council is obligated under the Planning and Environment Act to accept every application it receives and assess it in accordance with any State and Local policies that may apply and make a decision.  Any party aggrieved by Council's decision (objector or applicant) can appeal to VCAT should they wish to.  My advice at this stage in the process is for you to lodge an objection to the application and participate in the decision making process.

        Regards

    text: I agree completely! And have the council (in their always infinite wisdom)
      considered how our roads, sewerage and other utilities will cope with all the
      extra demand placed upon them? I don't see any upgrades happening at the water
      sewerage processing plant, all I've seen is our roads being resurfaced causing
      massive delays and insane diversions, all for some traffic lights the road doesn't
      need! Crazy council, it seems they just go crazy when they see dollar signs,
      and all rules are waived, if youve got enough cash.

      the fact that the council OK''d 2 more large towers to be built in this small
      area of Woody Point.  The thought that we have to go through yet another build
      with trucks and dirt, dust and noise for over 2 years in this small area of
      Woody Point is depressing.  When this developer built along Woodcliffe Crs a
      couple of years ago there were numerous complaints from neighbors to the police
      and council which seemed to fall on deaf ears. I moved here 10 years ago thinking
      this was a wonderful sleepy beachside area, but now it is getting as bad as

        Dear Janice

        Thank you for your comment.

        I share community concern over the location of the proposed service station and will not support the proposal. I understand it once was a motorbike repair shop with petrol bowsers, but this is the past and not the future. A service station would not be a good outcome considering proximity to a high population primary school and the childcare centre with its outdoor playspace facing to the street.

        I am surprised to see an application for a service station at this location. A recent development for a car wash on the same site caused very similar community concerns around traffic safety and was withdrawn prior to making it to Council for determination.

        The development application is an "AA" use which requires Council to exercise discretion, rather than simply being a permitted use. Council Members don't have a role in determining which, and when, applications are advertised, as this function is carried out by Administration who are obligated to advertise development applications prior to making a recommendation to Council.

        I'll ask the Vincent Development Services staff when this application is likely to be considered by Council, and will let you know. I would be very happy to meet with concerned residents about the application.

        Best regards

    text: 'As a nearby resident of Blackford St, I find this application out of step
      with the desire to reduce traffic along Scarborough Beach Road and divert same
      to Green Street. The location does not lead itself to an increase of traffic
      which this proposal would do given its proximity to the local primary school
      and early learning centre. The intersection is already quite difficult to navigate
      given the curvature of the roads and having traffic entering Scarborough Beach
      Road from this location would be unsafe and may also impact traffic from Ellesmere

        Dear Rose

        Thank you for your comment.

        I share community concern over the location of the proposed service station and will not support the proposal. I understand it once was a motorbike repair shop with petrol bowsers. A service station would not be a good outcome considering proximity to a high population primary school and the childcare centre with its outdoor playspace facing to the street.

        I am surprised to see an application for a service station at this location. A recent development for a car wash on the same site caused very similar community concerns around traffic safety and was withdrawn prior to making it to Council for determination.

        The development application is an "AA" use which requires Council to exercise discretion, rather than simply being a permitted use. Council Members don't have a role in determining which, and when, applications are advertised, as this function is carried out by Administration who are obligated to advertise development applications prior to making a recommendation to Council.

        I'll ask the Vincent Development Services staff when this application is likely to be considered by Council, and will let you know. I would be very happy to meet with concerned residents about the application.

        As a nearby resident of Blackford St, I find this application out of step with the desire to reduce traffic along Scarborough Beach Road and divert same to Green Street. The location does not lead itself to an increase of traffic which this proposal would do given its proximity to the local primary school and early learning centre. The intersection is already quite difficult to navigate given the curvature of the roads and having traffic entering Scarborough Beach Road from this location would be unsafe and may also impact traffic from Ellesmere St, not to mention she young children are attempting to get to school safely. I strongly oppose this proposal.

        Dear Jae

        Thank you for your feedback. I share community concerns about the location of the proposed service station and do not think this is the right land use for this site. It once was a service station, but that is no longer a good outcome considering proximity to a high population primary school and the childcare centre with its outdoor playspace facing to the street. That, as well as the changing nature of the Scarborough Beach Road corridor.

      rejected a proposed drive-through bottle shop on the corner of Scarborough Beach
      Road and Egina Street, based on very similar traffic congestion, traffic safety,
      and community concerns. This provides Council with an important precedent, with

      20 meters of a Daycare Centre.  This will significantly impact an already congested
      and 'blind spot' section of Scarborough Beach Road, and pose significant risk

        Dear Stephanie

        Thank you for providing feedback on the development application. I am also surprised to see an application for a petrol station at this location. The recent development for a car wash on the same site caused very similar community concerns around traffic and proximity to both the childcare centre and Mt Hawthorn Primary School. That application was withdrawn prior to making it to Council for determination.

        The site was once a service station, but transitioned away from that to become a shop with alfresco eating area as Mt Hawthorn Fresh. Unfortunately, that business didn't continue but I would prefer to see a similar use and I agree that a service station is not suitable in this location due to the issues raised.

        Hi Judy,

        I share your frustrations!

        First of all, the developers, will most often try to maximise their yield in anyway they can. To me it does not make sense to scrimp on quality because I truly believe people will pay for quality in our area.

        My experience is that Councillors usually identify a car parking waiver request as a symptom of an over development and treat it so. Our planning office will rarely support a waiver of parking. There are technical uses of the term which sometimes don't result in a real reduction, they are rare and usually linked to change of use applications. They sometimes get support.

        As to the Zone Controls, well we had mandatory heights in most parts of Boroondara, but Richard Wynne removed them down the spine of Boroondara between Christmas and Near Year 2015 when most people where oblivious to the action.

        Due to successive planning ministers we have not been given the controls we need in the scheme to fulfil the outcomes you describe, which are entirely consistent with Council's aspirations and request.

        My own discussions with applicants is to encourage them to commence their application meeting the requirements. I urge those reading this to approach us this way because it makes for the fastest approval.

        The vast majority of applications are incomplete and non compliant on the day they arrive. Most pushing the envelope. Some use this as a mechanism to get to VCAT as soon as the can.

        So while we have no control over the applications, we do have control over what we approve. When applications are advertised they usually carry the wording from the application form. Advertising does not equate to approval.

        I share your concerns, and we do our utmost to get the best outcome we can on each application. Sometimes that leads to refusal, sometimes to VCAT where more than half of what we decide is upheld. Most applications get an outcome with conditions to protect local amenity.

        Regards

        Phillip

        Hi Bettina,

        I'm away for a few more days yet but have passed on to relevant staff. I have promulgated a review of our trees on public land policy to dissuade some if the less necessary removals, but that drafting process is still with staff.

      clogs the trains,  trams and roads. \r\n\r\nIt also add more people into the
      parks,  schools,  etc.\r\n\r\nSuggest 10- 20 percent of the construction cost
      is paid to provide additional capacity on existing infrastructure. Eg new pedestrian
      path bridge between Hartwell and Burwood,  widening /upgrading paths / lighting
      / new park facilities / upgrades to rail stations and surrounds / new  road
      furniture - calming / crossings / replanting of mature saplings...are just some
      thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe buildings must not create landmarks. These beasts are affecting
      people further away than adjacent properties. They are not adequately informing
      people from futher away that they will be affected. The 25 Trent street development
      is visible from HIGH STREET! \r\n\r\nThe heights should be minimised using more
      expensive infrastructure - hydraulic lifts that do not need machine rooms on
      the roof.\r\n\r\nThey need to provide car parking according to planning regs.
      The reality is we will not be getting any better train or tram services on the
      Alamein line. "

    text: Agree entirely with the comments made by Ms Judy Brown. The indiscriminate
      construction of dwellings without any thought whatsoever to the impact on local
      amenities and infrastructure should cease immediately. Many public schools (e.g.
      Balwyn High School, GWSC) have already stopped taking in new students despite
      families living well within the school's zone because the schools simply don't
      have the required capacity to absorb this huge growth in student numbers. Consequently
      children have to look for another school that is far from their residence. Too
      many apartments and townhouses squeezed into small blocks are a detriment to
      our already creaking infrastructure. What steps have council taken/will be taking
      to address our concerns? This is not a case of NIMBYism - build by all means
      but give permits ONLY AFTER ensuring that existing infrastructure is upgraded
      and can meet the spurt in population. It is high time that our problems are
      addressed not merely by lip service.

    text: "Councillors of Boorondara must consider whether their ratepaying residents
      whom they represent choose to live in the area because of multiple constructions

      as Glen Iris Milk Bar, Leo's Fine Foods, Monacos Delicatessen are all supported
      by 2 x high density dwellings in Camberwell Junction, the apartments at Ferndale
      Park, multiple sub divided units in and along Toorak road such as Dickens Street
      to name a few. Then for public services as one example, Hartwell Primary already
      has 4 sometimes 5 x 25+ student Prep intakes every year. \r\n\r\nSo if the answer

    text: "The population growth in Melbourne needs to be seriously cut back and controlled
      to allow services to catch up with the greatly increased demands on amenities
      and also if we want to keep the suburbs of Melbourne as liveable as they have
      been in the past.\r\n\r\nOverdevelopment is turning the \"world's most liveable
      city\" into a concrete jungle. 45 dwellings over 4 lots in Toorak, Road Camberwell,
      is yet another example of inappropriate development and must be scaled back
      dramatically. No doubt the 4 lots currently include trees and greenery which
      allows for water to replenish the water table. This overdevelopment, which is
      happening everywhere, is very damaging to the environment by raising temperatures
      caused by the loss of the shade and oxygen provided by trees. New developments
      of this size, if permitted, ought to be required to be green buildings with
      provision for vegetation over the building and a set back from the street of
      at least three meters allowing for planting there also.\r\n\r\nTraffic interruption
      during construction, increased traffic on already saturated roads, demands on
      schools, public transport and other infrastructure is already a problem. \r\n\r\nJudy
      Brown mentions the increasing problem of less traffic control provided by developers
      on construction sites. This is a problem I personally had, when a reversing
      truck ran into me whilst backing a huge truck, for carrying cranes, into busy
      traffic on Canterbury Road. There was no flagman to control the traffic. I ended
      up doing the job of the flag person to stop traffic so he could complete his
      backing manoeuvre! This could have been a serious accident for me. I was lucky
      that there was no one beside me when I swerved to avoid him. He still hit me."

      for this to go to because not only do I think you fit the profile but I think
      you are one of the few councilors who actually cares enough to respond and wants
      development to be appropriate! This is just too much it's getting out of hand
      and I would like to see this development  not go ahead. This is part of the
      street I live on and we already have quite a few townhouses.  The traffic on
      such a narrow street is beyond a joke and it's getting to be dangerous driving
      or walking anywhere.  The developers don't give any thought to the amount of
      vehicles this will cause on such a small suburban street. We have three on a
      block next to us with parking for one and a half cars each - they at times all
      have two to three cars each with no where to park but on the narrow street,
      I hope in this case common sense will prevail!

      visitor car parking space.Essex street is so narrow that when cars park on both
      sides its difficult for cars both ways to cross.And last i would urge strongly
      for the Moreland Council to stop developments in moreland ,its causing congestion
      on the roads,no parking space .no backyards to enjoy,and no clean space to breathe
      because of congestion.Listen to the neighbourhood rate payers and stop developments
      before its too late.

      It is one of the genuine historic beauties in the street. If there was ever
      a house worth preserving in thirroul this is surely one of them. My family and
      I are the current tenants. AT NO STAGE IN THE ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS
      HAS ANY AUTHORITY ACTUALLY ENTERED THE HOUSE TO EXAMINE AND DETERMINE THE HISTORICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BUILDING. Surely this demonstrates a flawed and questionable

    text: What a pity I only just found out about this site.  The development underway
      will be an eye sore, much like the one next to Pascoe Vale Station.  The congestion
      in that area alone due to trains is unbearable, add workmen for lets say 6 months,
      and now a multi story complex with 21 dwellings?  Who knows what that will bring.  At
      what stage is the over development of dwellings in the area going to be addressed.  It
      is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate through roads due to the number
      of parked vehicles.  Nature strips are not altered to accommodate the additional
      vehicles and widen the already narrow roads.  Emergency vehicles I'm sure are
      finding it difficult to manoeuvre not to mention the weekly garbage collections.  There
      is also only one public secondary college in the area supporting an ever growing
      population.  Housing affordability is not caused by the average Joe who owns
      an investment property and negative gearing, its caused by greedy councils and
      the developers who take advantage of the short sighted policies with short term
      goals and long term problems.  Where is the infrastructure development to support
      the unrelenting development of units.  Come on Moreland council, stop reaping
      the benefits of the housing boom in the area, and re-invest where it counts,
      in building strong and resilient communities.

        Thanks for your email Bridget.

        The height controls in DDO29 are discretionary, so the bulk and height of the building will come down to what the planning officer considers to be a fair given other building heights in the vicinity. I will follow the progress of the planning application as it is assessed.

        Hello Wendy,

        On Councils web site you can go into Planning and Building, use PD Online, type in the address and all the information on that lit will come up.Hopefully the link above will work for you.   This shows the block being divided into 3 which is allowed under the Planning Scheme.I agree with you that the unit developments and sub divisions of the larger blocks changes the character of an area.   These developments we are seeing are approved as in the 2006 planning scheme major changes to zoning were included to increase density....which means developments of this nature.At present we are assessing the draft City Plan which is the first time since 2006 the scheme has been rewritten.   Though we can't fix the wrongs from the past I can assure you I am doing all I can to ensure This plan doesn't make the situation worse and where possible protects our Redlands values and lifestyle.Please have a look at the link and let me know if you need any further information.Warm regardsWendyWarm RegardsCr Wendy BoglaryOn 10 Dec 2016, at 10:24 AM, Wendy McPate <<mailto:>> wrote:

        Hi Kirsti,

        Thanks for your email. I live around the corner and know exactly what you mean. Until the State Government puts the breaks on, this is going to continue and it's a disgrace.

        Residents are selling up because of this reason and I'm just one who is 100% behind you on over development.

        They say affordable housing, urban sprawl ect, etc. what a load of bull dust. I live in Eastgate Street and our street is honestly no different!

        I'm hearing you load and clear Kirsti and will continue to fight on your behalf.

    text: " Dear Sir,\r\n \r\nI’m the owner of 6 Hall Road Hornsby and have lived
      here for 46 years.\r\n\r\nI only recently become aware of the Development Application
      to develop 30 Hall Road as a child care centre. I wish to advise Council of
      my concern in regard to this proposal.\r\n\r\nI am surprised that Council did
      not notified all residents of Hall Road and surrounding roads of this proposed
      development, given the impact such development will have on local residents.\r\n\r\nThis
      is profoundly a residential area and I believe it is inappropriate to insert
      a commercial type development, such as proposed, within a quiet residential
      zone.\r\n\r\nExcluding the high rise apartments on Pacific Highway and College
      Crescent, the resident population in this area over the past several decades
      has remained relatively static and any marginal increase in housing/population
      has arisen largely from existing residential lots being sub-divided or, as presently
      occurring, via the introduction of granny flats.\r\n\r\nI believe the continuing
      increase of high rise developments in the Hornsby area is, and will continue
      to be, the major cause for any increase in the need for child care facilities.
      If Council feel there is a need for a child care facility within Hornsby central
      area, then Council could consider making it compulsory for multi unit developments
      to make provision for such facilities via a levy and also identify which future
      developments incorporate child care facilities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development
      is surrounded by existing residential homes. I’m aware those residents are highly
      concerned for their future peaceful existence if Council approves this application.
      The continual use of a shared driveway to service the proposed child care centre
      would be a huge invasion of privacy and would also have major safety issues.\r\n\r\nSafety
      is a major factor. The proposed site is half way down the hill between Clovelly
      Road and Innes Ave. There are frequently cars parked on both sides of the road
      and there are also bus stops. It’s often necessary to pull over to permit approaching
      vehicles to pass. Furthermore, Hall Rd, Clovelly Road and Frederick Street have
      become a major thoroughfare and are used more and more as a :”rat run” by motorists
      attempting to by-pass travelling through Hornsby to reach the western side of
      Hornsby. Many motorists frequently drive above the speed limit, adding further
      danger to local residents and potentially endangering children and parents doing
      drop off/pick up in the event this proposal is approved.\r\n\r\nI don’t dispute
      the need for child facilities - however, there needs to be  a proper study undertaken
      to determine current and future needs as well as establishing locations to meet
      those needs. For instance, it may be a better alternative to consider re-development
      of the existing Scout Hall in Reddy Park to accommodate both the Scout Hall
      and a child care centre as this may provide a more suitable solution for local
      residents, children attending a child care centre and also providing  for the
      scouting fraternity.\r\n\r\nI’m aware a whole load of reports are required to
      accompany such development applications and I’m sure they give the “tick” of
      approval, but none of those reports really take account of the psychological
      impact such a development will have on current residents and their need and
      expectation to live a normal and peaceful lifestyle. When the surrounding homes
      (which are all relatively new homes) were built, I believe there was no indication
      of the intent to develop this land for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nI believe
      this proposed development is inappropriately located and approval should be
      denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\n\r\nBernard O’Hara\r\n6 Hall Road\r\nHornsby

        Thank you for your email regarding 66-70 Wright Street Highgate,

        This application will be decided by the Development Assessment Panel rather than coming before Council and, as such, I am not a decision maker in this instance.  However I I take on board your comments regarding the scale of the development and impact on local amenity.  It is important that infill development is carefully managed to ensure positive outcomes for residents and the broader community.

        I agree that it looks like a very small plot for this size development. I'll have a look at the plot of land in the next couple of days. Feel free to give me a ring to discuss. I am keen to know what concerns people have about the development. My number is 0417 583 664.

      ridiculous as most residents need and have 2 cars as there is very little public

      try to drive down the Stud Road service Road opp the Stud Park shops and Stamford

      and more residents and immigration. We have lost our lovely leafy green 1/3

      developing and growing the population. There is no stopping it.  \r\n"

    text: "Comments on why the Grandstand Apartments development should not be approved
      by Melbourne City Council\r\n\r\n1. Loss of area’s character and integrity,
      and physical effects of the proposed ‘Grandstand’ Apartments\r\n\r\nThe proposed
      ‘Grandstand Apartments’ development is at odds with the Melbourne Planning Scheme
      http://planningschemes.dpcd.vic.gov.au/schemes/melbourne/ordinance/21_mss15_melb.pdf,
      in particular:\r\n\r\nHousing\r\n•\tEnsure development in residentially zoned
      areas of Kensington maintains its generally low scale nature of heritage streetscapes
      and buildings.\r\n•\tEnsure development in Kensington Banks maintains its generally
      low scale nature\r\nEnvironment and heritage\r\n•\tEnsure development in the
      residentially zoned (stable residential) area of Flemington and Kensington maintains
      its generally low scale nature of heritage streetscapes and\r\n•\tbuildings.\r\n•\tEnsure
      development in Kensington Banks maintains its generally low scale nature.\r\n\r\nThe
      scale and bulk of the development with 82 apartments proposed at a maximum building
      height of 9 storeys (34.5 meters) is inappropriate within the Kensington Banks
      boundary. The modular design form does not equate with the local character and
      heritage values of Kensington Banks, which is mostly medium density 2 to 4 story
      townhouse development incorporating communal open space and aspects of an earlier
      livestock and saleyards history. \r\n\r\nIt is disingenuous for the developers
      to equate this proposal as located in an extension of the Racecourse and Showgrounds
      precincts. Kensington Banks is residential rather than recreational. The proposed
      development is more appropriate to Docklands. It is out of character with surrounding
      dwellings and jeapodises the integrity of the Kensington Banks development which
      has been upheld internationally as an exemplar of urban renewal.\r\n\r\nThis
      development as outlined would affect us personally. The apartment ‘Grandstand’
      would be visible from our premises, casting a shadow over our two-story townhouse
      and surrounding residences. Reduction of sunlight would affect our garden, our
      pets and our ability to enjoy sitting outside. Along with other neighbours we
      are now hesitant to install solar panels given potential loss of sunlight. \r\n\r\n2.
      Carparking and traffic\r\n\r\nThe request by the developers for a reduction
      in carparking provision is completely unacceptable given the current existing
      lack of available resident parking in the area. This is particularly noticeable
      after business hours and at weekends when it is difficult to find parking. There
      is already a significant problem with finding visitor parking in the area.\r\n\r\nTraffic
      is also an increasing safety problem in the area given Gatehouse St is used
      as a thoroughfare to and from Smithfield Road. Cars travel fast in a confined,
      heavily parked area. Pedestrians and drivers need to take extreme care crossing
      or turning into Gatehouse St. in particular. An increase in traffic and parking
      demand would compound existing problems for local residents and those in transit.\r\n"

    text: "I am resident of Gatehouse Drive and concur with the aforementioned comments
      against this new development of apartments in Kensington, particularly in the
      location proposed. The reasons for this include:\r\n\r\n1. Congestion of traffic
      and noise pollution - there is already too much non-local traffic that use Gatehouse
      Drive as a thoroughfare between Smithfield Rd and Kensington Rd and further
      high density development will exacerbate this. The increase in traffic will
      also create an unacceptable amount of noise pollution on Gatehouse Drive which
      is bad enough for local residents already. \r\nBear in mind there is also ANOTHER
      block of apartments being constructed on Hobsons Rd Kensington adding further
      traffic burden to the Kensington area. \r\n2. Inadequate parking - street parking
      on Gatehouse Drive and surrounding streets is currently saturated by local residents.
      A further development of >90 apartments will add to this burden. \r\n3. Liveability
      - Kensington is already quite population dense with mainly townhouses and units.
      There is also an existing apartment tower on Smithfield Rd and Speakmen St.
      In addition to this, there is a new block of apartment being constructed on
      Hobsons Rd in Kensington as well as on the corner of Racecourse Rd and Epsom
      Rd. \r\n\r\nI sincerely feel this is a terrible idea for the local community.
      Please do the job that you have been elected to do, represent your constituents
      of Kensington and prevent this development from becoming a reality and ruining
      our community. "

    text: "Having read the comments regarding this development, I echo these in my
      objection to the planning authority.\r\n\r\nAs a resident of Kensington, I strongly
      object to the proposed development to construct a mixed multi storey building,
      change of use to accommodation (dwelling) and a reduction to the parking requirements
      of clause 52.06 in this location. \r\n\r\nThe following points state how the
      proposal will negatively affect our community.\r\n\r\n•\tTraffic Congestion.\r\n\r\nThe
      proposed 82 Apartments with 1 to 2 cars per household (http://profile.id.com.au/australia/car-ownership)
      will introduce an additional 82 to 164 cars to the immediate vicinity. Traffic
      in the morning and evening is already at a standstill on Gatehouse Drive, let
      alone adding an influx of traffic to an already busy area. \r\n\r\n•\tLack of
      car parking.\r\n\r\nPlease do not reduce the car parking requirements for this
      development. This will only serve to benefit developers, whilst leaving the
      local community significantly worse off. Parking is already a struggle and this
      will vastly exacerbate the problem. Any development of 16-22 Gatehouse Drive
      must have adequate parking included.\r\n\r\n•\tOut of Character\r\n\r\nThis
      development is totally inappropriate for Kensington Banks and will have a negative
      impact on the surrounding environment as both an eye sore, as well as significantly
      affect the distribution of natural light in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThis
      proposed development is not in keeping with the Kensington Banks area and height
      restrictions should be addressed – this is three times (x3) the height of apartments
      across the road and is totally inappropriate for a suburban area, as it creates
      privacy concerns for nearby neighbours.\r\n\r\nAs a resident of Kensington Banks
      for the past 5 years, I fear that a beautiful pocket of Kensington is becoming
      a densely populated nightmare! With all of the additional high rise apartments
      currently being constructed nearby (corner Epsom & Ascot Vale Rds and Footscray
      Rd) this further addition will crush us. We simply do not have the infrastructure
      to cope with more cars – which affects parking and road congestion, as well
      as a complete lack of privacy for existing residences. \r\n\r\nKensington is
      a 'community' which seems to have been targeted for building apartments for
      the masses. It is already a day to day struggle to find parking, fight local
      traffic and get anywhere at all in your car when there is an event on at the
      Show Grounds. \r\n\r\nYou simply must consider these multiple factors as well
      as the local communities’ opinions before adding another high rise building
      with no care for the outcome for the people who live in this area. \r\n\r\nThis
      is not something that will improve our way of life or make Melbourne a better
      place to live. More apartments is not the way to go, better infrastructure and
      planning is what this city desperately needs.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel"

    text: 'Utterly ridiculous to even contemplate such a ghastly development in this
      area. We have long suffered the traffic and parking problems in this neighbourhood
      ;  Spring racing carnival and major events at the Showgrounds cause enormous
      traffic congestion and trying to exit our area via gatehouse drive and Smithfield
      street intersection makes it infuriatingly difficult and often dangerous for
      local residents to go anywhere on those days. Can anyone responsible for planning
      development in Kensington just consider the appalling impact this unnecessary
      and ill conceived grasp for profit over local amenity wil have on us, the residents?
      We have lived in this area for 20 years and luckily have a garage, but the daily
      battles by residents to park near their own homes is increasingly frustrating.
      Some of the larger homes near us have four cars, don''t use their garages and
      are quite aggressive in asserting their desire to park outside their (or our
      property). Our streets are very difficult to negotiate because of parking on
      both sides and the daily "rat running" from Smithfield Rd through to Kensington
      Rd creates a lot of tension and bad behaviour from drivers unwilling to take
      their turn to cross the single lane stock route.  If this development was approved
      (even in  smaller size) there would have to be changes made to the flow of traffic
      at both entry and exit points for this community. Any reduction in the free
      and safe use of the parks, stock route dual use path and consideration for residents''
      well being would be a betrayal of what was originally planned for this area
      of Kensington, which was medium density housing!! We have many, young families
      living here now and their children are able to play in our small parks, but
      more traffic, impatient drivers and increased population via high density accommodation
      will probably make it too dangerous for kids to cross the street. It is time
      to look at the appalling high rise block on the corner of Epsom Rd and Ascot
      Vale Rd and ask whether Melbourne City Council wants to follow that example.
      Councillors cannot boast about Melbourne''s liveable city status and then go
      ahead and make this little pocket of Melbourne a living disaster. NO inappropriate
      development here are anywhere in Kensngton. '

      the east, traffic is through a shared single road, The Crescent, where cars
      have to queue up to take turns to drive across the pedestrianised Stock Route.  Adding

    text: "To whom it may concern,\r\nOnce a beautiful quiet pocket is becoming a
      DENSELY POPULATED nightmare! With all of the additional high rise apartments
      currently being constructed nearby (corner Epsom & Ascot Vale Rds) and Footscray
      Rd this further addition will crush us. We simply do not have the infrastructure
      to cope with more cars - parking and road congestion, complete lack of privacy
      for existing residences.  How high, how many apartments? How many car parking
      spaces? Public transport? \r\nKensington is a 'community' which seems to have
      been targeted for building apartments for the masses. It is already a day to
      day struggle to find parking, fight local traffic and get anywhere at all in
      your car when there is an even on at show grounds. You simply must consider
      these multiple factors as well as the local communities opinions before you
      slap another building up and not care about the outcome for the people who live
      in this area. Why, WHY are you determined to desecrate our suburb? Such bad
      planning destroys the beauty and the reason why people want to live here in
      the first place. This is not something that will improve our way of life or
      make Melbourne a better place to live. More apartments is not the way to go,
      better infrastructure and planning is what this country desperately needs... "

    text: This is a thin street, where car parking and congestion is already a problem.
      While the Moreland approach to urban density along main transport corridors
      sounds excellent in theory, thought must be given to liveability. People will
      continue to own cars in this area - the public transport and bike paths simply
      aren't good enough, or safe enough, to do without. This means that congestion
      and parking will become a huge issue as developments like this continue to be
      approved at such an incredible rate. Developers who have made, and are making,
      such incredible profit from our neighbourhoods, communities and homes should
      be required to add to the amenity, rather than bit by bit, destroying it.

        Hi Andrew,

        I'm uncertain why the planning alert was late however the application you are referring to was a code assessable  development which met with the requirements of the current planning scheme.
        Hope that helps. Let me know if I can assist in any other way.

      The law should determine the distance between all future high rise residential
      buildings, e.g. no less than 100m from each other. There also should be a law
      that would oblige developers to create (within that 100m radius area) green
      zones, parks and/or playgrounds, other socially useful infrastructure for future
      residents of the building that they are seeking a approval for.

        plans. These informally substituted plans therefore superseded the advertised
        plans which you may have seen.\n\nThe final plans were for a building that
        was under the height control of 60m, and compliant with the 10m tower separation
        requirements of the scheme (with one exception being a pinch point of 9.52m
        which nevertheless met the built form objectives of the control). This 10m
        tower separation control was introduced by the Planning Minister in November
        2016.\n\nYou can see the full report of our planners here:\nhttp://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-council/committees-meetings/meeting-archive/MeetingAgendaItemAttachments/773/13868/AGENDA%20ITEM%206.2.pdf\n\nThe

      broker said they very carefully scrutinise at any mortgage application for this
      part of the the Southbank area, especially Dorcas Street, because there is a
      GLUT of apartments and they do not think most apartments in this area will hold
      their value.\r\nI don't understand why permits are being given for new apartment
      buildings when there is already a glut - you can see from reviewing the real
      estate ads over time that owners are having difficulty reselling apartments
      in this area.\r\nI was also informed at the time of purchase that the area from
      Coventry towards Southbank Blvd had been designated as 'the village' for its
      low-rise development and that there were restrictions on building high-rise
      buildings in this area. \r\nUnfortunately now it appears that approvals are
      being given to 20-storey buildings on Coventry street willy nilly, with one
      approved at #25-27 and one under construction at #31 and an application for
      the space between. OK these are all side by side and you've approved a block
      of tall buildings on that section...\r\nBut please, please reject the application
      for 83-89 Coventry Street as it will stick up like a sore thumb on that corner,
      ruining the lower-rise streetscape on the two blocks from Wells to Sturt St
      and overlooking residents all around, impacting their privacy and their views.

      SIGN END DATE: 4 August 2016\r\n\r\nDear Sir/Madam\r\nWe wish to advise Council
      that we, as concerned community property owner/residents, strongly object to
      this proposed DA to demolish this beautiful historical Heritage listed house!
      \ The reasons given by the applicant to have this Heritage listing over-turned,
      so it can be demolished, hold absolutely no merit, other than for the owner/
      applicant’s personal financial gain in further developing  this double-width
      block. It  was a Heritage listed house when it was bought in 2007. Public Rental
      \ Records show it was advertised in 2014 as a ‘5 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 2 car
      house for $895 per week’. \r\nNo. 9 Station St will definitely not be left ‘as
      a single isolated property’ as I have been told by the owners of the No.8 Bellevue
      Street property,  that backs onto it, that it’s their family home & will not
      be sold by this generation nor the next for ‘any amount’ of money! (This may
      well be the case too for Nos. 4 & 6 Bellevue St & 11 Station Street (2-storey)
      & others in this Station St Precinct zone).  To many of the owner residents
      ‘their home is their Castle’ where they have lots of daily interaction with
      their adult children/grandchildren/extended family/neighbours , lots being from
      the same lovely local Thornleigh Lebanese Community who’ve resided in Station
      & Bellevue Streets since approx the 1950’s.\r\nBuilding materials for ‘Brick
      Houses’ were very expensive & in short supply locally in the early 1920’s. Materials
      such as window sized glass, roof tiles, mirrors etc  often  needed to be imported
      by ship, from mainly France & England This took time & was costly. Houses were
      few, especially of only recently attainable bricks after WW1. This fine  4-bedroom
      \ home was a big expensive achievement by Mr. William Pollard and his wife &
      needs to remain Historically protected for current & future generations to admire
      & enjoy!\r\nHeritage Register Item No.1718\r\nThis Heritage house also has been
      deemed historically important by having it’s house name ‘St Kilda’ historically
      recorded!  (Hornsby Shire Historical Society, ‘Historic Home Names in Hornsby
      Shire’). \r\nCouncil records indicate several Heritage Review updates  on this
      property since 1994 incl 2014, all with the same consistent outcome, to retain
      this early 1920’s (1923) unique era combination styled home on the Heritage
      Register! \r\nNo. 9 Station St “St. Kilda’s’  Heritage Listing would well benefit
      by including further historical notes,  re it’s original owner/family history,
      \ the land/area/growth  through  generations, from ‘Early Settlement’ times
      .  Historical research indicates this double-lot was part of an original 1833
      640acres land grant to John Thorne, Chief Constable of Parramatta, for an act
      of bravery of apprehending dangerous Bushrangers!  It was known then as ‘Thorne’s
      Farm’  at Pennant Hills & was re-named later as Thornleigh  in honor of John
      Thorne. As was Hornsby named after the other brave Constable Horne, granted
      320 acres further north incl what’s now called Pearce’s Corner.\r\nBelow please
      find just some of the additional researched information about the original house
      owner , which supports  this home’s/it’s owner’s  ‘unique’ Historical significance
      in Thornleigh! \r\n 1923 Mr William Pollard, Butcher originally built this prime
      ‘statement’  of a late Federation style home from popular styles/objects/materials
      \ all ‘of the Era’ (early 1920’s) to include the best features from Federation,
      Victorian, Queen Anne & early Arts and Crafts periods. “St. Kilda’ boasts numerous
      top design features of the era, both architecturally & ‘fashion wise’. Perhaps
      that’s where this house name came from – St Kilda, Melbourne , renown then as
      fashion leaders. \r\n1895 Mr William Pollard (fondly known as Wil) worked locally
      during this year as a Butcher , at his Brother-in law’s Butchery business.  His
      brother-in-law was also named Wil (for William) & so they were known as ‘The
      Two Wills’.\r\n1895 That same year  Mr W. Pollard commenced erecting a ‘Butcher
      Shop’, fronting the main road (now Pennant Hills Rd)  & close to the original
      1890 School of Arts Building, Thornleigh  (Thornleigh Public School) .   \r\nMr
      Pollard, his brother/s & family Butcher’s business grew  and the Pollards had
      several shops within the Hornsby Shire, also supplying customers much further
      away in bulk.  ‘Pollard Bros Butchers’ Pennant Hills Rd Thornleigh  is Historically
      recorded in ‘The Sands’ 1924 along with numerous Pollard family members names
      & addresses including Station & Bellevue Sts, Pennant Hills Rd, Eddy Ave & elsewhere
      within Pennant Hills/Thornleigh area. http://cdn.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/learn/history/archives/sands/1920-1924/1923-part16.pdf\r\nMany
      Pollards are also listed here at their various NSW farms – perhaps these farms
      supplied their Butcher Shop stock. \r\n1919 Land Subdivision allotment sale
      advertised  -  ‘Hillmont Estate’ Thornleigh land sale, incl 2 x cottages on
      blocks,  the cottages known as ‘Hillmont’ & ‘Avarua’.  These land blocks are
      bounded by Thornleigh St, Station St, Bellevue St, Railway Parade, Park Street,
      Hillmont Avenue & Pennant Hills Rd.  \r\nIn 1919 Thornleigh was a very small
      village with a growing population.  Families were encouraged to have many children
      & to invite family members to live there. Some of the older Orchard Farms (on
      original 1833 Grant land) were subdivided into smaller houseing allotments.
      \r\nWe sincerely hope providing this Historical background evidence supports
      \ No. 9 Station St  not being  demolished and this DA application is denied.\r\n "

        Good afternoon Larry,
        At this point we don't have a lot of information. We know the development applications were lodged by the Castalia Group and they have advised they expect to be operational by December 2017. They may send through details of someone who can deal with employment opportunities in the near future. If I do get this information I will be sure to forward it on.
        Thanks
        Brooke

    text: This process of redevelopment and planning for the Community Centre has
      been underway for quite a time now. There are plans up in the building itself
      (if anyone wishes to view them). However, with this coming to my notice today,
      via this site, it has just made me realise how late the general population hears
      about these developments. If you were involved in the centre, you may have been
      aware of this, however people not involved - possibly not... Unfortunately I
      would think it too late for people to protest about the redevelopment. There
      has been much consulting about this, and decisions have been made. Rightly or
      wrongly. Communication of these types of developments within Boroondara need
      to flagged earlier if anyone has a chance of putting in sound argument against
      a development.

    text: Changing Brisbane Streets landscape into one of multi unit townhouses and
      units significantly affects the character of the area. It also creates a city
      environment in which many people are packed into small areas where few residents
      know one another. The effect of this development on the landscape of Brisbane
      Street and Old Berwick (which has already been over developed) needs to be addressed.
      Drip lines of the magnificent trees that form an important part of the Old Berwick
      landscape (and are unique to the area) need to be respected as does the ability
      to maintain a town feel rather than a dense cityscape.

    text: Ashwood Drive is  a beautiful street full of established properties with
      single dwellings - the neighbourhood character is about families and a green
      environment. Adding multi-storey, multiple dwellings on a single property is
      totally against the character of the street and suburb. It will also add excessive
      pressure to the streetscape (ie dangerously narrowing the street for driving
      and making parking more difficult for existing residents), the storm water system,
      the sewers and other infrastructure in the area.

    text: Morton ST is in an area of single dwelling properties and adding two double
      story dwellings on the property changes the neighbour character. It will also
      add pressure to the area for parking, street access, old water and sewerage
      systems and a reduction in vegetation, green space and porous land, all of which
      is unnecessary in an older established area like Burwood especially in places
      away from public transport.

    text: "We have received reliable information that plans have been drafted to redevelop
      the Markham Avenue site which was home to 54 public housing units.  The planned
      development will consist of a cluster of buildings ranging in height from two
      storey townhouses, three storey, four storey, five storey and six storey apartment
      buildings to accommodate a total of 252 units of which 62 will be public housing
      units.  The remaining 190 units will be sold-off to private buyers. \r\n\r\nIt
      is my understanding that this application will not be subject to council approval
      and the application documents will be signed off by the minister for planning
      after the process of community consultation has been completed.  There will
      be no opportunity to appeal the development through VCAT.\r\n\r\nMany people
      in the community, particularly those living close to Markham Avenue are very
      concerned that a high-density, overdevelopment of this size and scale bordering
      a fragile but significant biodiversity corridor and public space will have a
      significant impact on the privacy of those living in the surrounding area.  Markham
      Avenue is a narrow street and there are concerns about the volume of traffic.
      \  It is of further concern that the development may not have sufficient allocated
      parking spaces to meet demand as only 31 out of the 62 public housing units
      will have a carpark on title.  This could create a problem with spillover parking
      onto the neighbouring streets.   There are also concerns that cars belonging
      to people living in the complex who are unable to access a carpark on site will
      occupy parking spaces set aside for visitors to the playground in Victory Boulevard
      and the sporting ground that is adjacent to the development.   \r\n\r\nMany
      people in the community are disappointed that they were not consulted about
      this project during the concept stage before the plans were drawn up as the
      land could have been utilised for other purposes such as a new primary school
      to meet the needs of a growing population of primary school age children or
      even an aged-care facility. '\r\n\r\nI also need to mention that Kevin Chow,
      Councillor for Solway Ward has stepped down and has been replaced by Garry Thompson.

    text: Paul, To my understanding the subject property would not be suited to contain
      three units based on the land area and the parking issues that will result in
      a neighbourhood already showing the signs of increased development. The area
      that was originally the one home on a large block with mature trees, has been
      denuded and sub divided into three blocks of land where the corner block adjoining
      has the original house on it. The result of the outcome, if approved, will be
      5 families and the relevant vehicle requirements where previously was 1. Curzon
      Street is already a busy thoroughfare and adding more cars, that will no doubt
      use the street parking, will detract from the area and cause unnecessary safety
      issues.

    text: "Seriously Joel R - which developer do you work for?  In the right area,
      with the right SIZED block of land no one will argue your point.  However, as
      you state this is a \"blue chip\" area where people desire to live (that used
      to be because there are large blocks of land surrounded by trees not a concrete,
      high density jungle).  It's an area where the residents pay for the privilege
      of living here, rates are ridiculous  - yet we are not entitled to a say as
      to what development is allowed in our surrounding area.  When you have a developer
      decide to rape the land beside you all for the god almighty dollar - we would
      love hear your opinion then.\r\n\r\nIf you have assessed/scrutinised these plans
      you will see that the developer has chosen to have extreme high density living
      on a block of land that is in the big scheme things suited to a family home.
      \ \r\n\r\nThere is absolutely NO outdoor living/lifestyle attached to any of
      these units - they will be looking into a fence.  There is no landscaping taken
      into consideration that befits the area at all and let's not forget that these
      3 units all require guest car parking x 2 per unit - where is that going?\r\n\r\nYou
      are obviously one of the rare individuals who would be very happy seeing your
      neighbours block sold, land stripped and filled to capacity with multiple dwellings.\r\n\r\nAlso,
      if you think that this 925sqm would comfortably fit SEVEN 2 bedroom units, you
      are either delusional or a developer.\r\n\r\n"

    text: I attended meeting with planning members of TRC and came away quite pleased
      at the apparent progress that was being made. However, the change (if it occurs)
      will not happen until the new town plan is adopted. Therefore, we see developers
      getting in at the detriment of older, character neighborhoods that will attract
      residents because of what they are to the dismay of those of us who bought,
      developed our older homes to keep this lovely area. The Council has the power
      to not approve developments but, would sooner leave it up to the poor working
      stiffs within Council to make the decisions and the Councillors can do a "Pontius
      Pilate" and wash their hands of any responsibility.

      of short term profit wrecking long term heritage values. \r\n\r\nHaving removed
      the significant stand of pines, a landmark on the ridge line, that were along
      the boundary of this property, this site and the streetscape will be ruined
      by high density housing. Apart from expected issues with traffic it is highly
      likely the architecture of what is built will be unsympathetic to the streetscape.
      High density housing will reduce space for gardens and street plantings thereby
      adversely affecting local microclimates. \r\n\r\nA fast track application and

    text: "With regard to this application we would like to express our utmost disapproval
      for the proposed multiple dwellings on the ‘so-called’ 63A Curzon Street.  In
      recent times the TRC has stated its intention to slow or stop the growth of
      units in non-appropriate areas within the city (ie: heritage areas).  This is
      one of the few remaining areas that has heritage appeal. To want to destroy
      such a lovely area with unsightly units is a purely profit-based decision with
      no regard to the heritage or the area, both past and future. The ‘Toowoomba
      unit plague’ does nothing to beautify our city.  Residents have chosen areas
      such as these to live in because of their beauty and heritage appeal. Approving
      this application is another step forward to taking this away.\r\nWe are hoping
      the council stands by their policy to cut back on the number of units allowed
      in heritage areas.\r\n\r\nGreed is not always good.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note
      that the online picture attached to this application does not depict the property
      in question - the application for 63A Curzon Street is a vacant piece of land.
      The picture is of the neighbouring property – number 63.\r\n\r\nDavid & Della"

      One does not need to see plans in order to respond to concerns about the car
      parking dispensation that is sought, having seen some of the poor outcomes for
      everyone (including repeated theft from vehicle incidents  affecting new residents
      forced to park in the street for want of on-site facilities). I support sensitive
      higher density development, affordable housing and a range of housing where
      we can all live with good amenity -this should not require me to relocate (as
      David seems to suggest I must) for wanting to wake up and listen to birds and

      and therefore the housing pricing have gone through the roof. We need more affordable
      housing so our younger generations can again gain back the dream of owning a
      home. We the neighbours highly support dense developments along Stud Road and
      Boronia Road within designated \"Residential Growth Zones\". In fact, they need
      to be proposing more townhouses, but, with adequate car spaces under the Residential
      Codes and state government policies.  "

    text: Of course the developer wants car parking dispensation, so he can make more
      profit from the site.  But the community has the reality that every adult resident
      does own a car, and they will park it where they can.  Five dwellings with an
      average of 1.5 adults per dwelling means 7 or 8 cars parked somewhere.  Plus
      visitors.  The community is paying a fortune for local roads that have become
      private parking for multi-unit residents.  Look left, look right, can't see
      a thing for parked cars.  The road is for driving on, not for parking cars.

      is Enough..What is happening to our once great semi-rural area, every day I
      receive the planning alert updates regarding a new development application to
      carve up beautiful land into barely liveable blocks with very little infrastructure,
      no new schools, and roads that are so poor that are only being patched up. As
      we have previously seen in the past two major floods, residents around the Logan
      Reserve Road area have been trapped in for days due to the flood prone roads....what
      has council done to rectify this serious situation...not a lot from my observation
      as a resident of 23 years. I do not accept that the State Government has all
      the say in the Planning of what is approved by developers, joint discussions
      by both parties must consider the bigger outcomes for the future of our suburbs
      not just  allow the developers to buy up little pockets here and there and allow
      them to walk away with very little interest in building communities. Please
      come clean and advise the local long time residents on the future development
      of Logan Reserve/Chambers Flat areas or risk being voted out at the next election
      as has been widely talked about in this current forum. I eagerly await your
      reply re this ongoing matter."

      text: "Hi Sue-Ann,\n\nI wish to try and answer your concerns in regards to the
        developments that you are seeing ion the area. First and foremost it is important
        to recognise some basic facts and then go from there. The area of Logan Reserve
        is in an area known as Emerging Community Footprint. This zoning is gazetted
        by the state government, not Council. \n\nThe Council is compelled by state
        planning legislation and law to assess any applications for development lodged
        in this area. Council is also compelled by this same legislation to approve
        applications in this area if those applications meet the state planning legislation
        criteria.\n\nAm I in favour of this? No, but the Council is compelled by law
        to follow this process. Because this area is an area that is designated as
        an emerging community footprint area it has no formal structure plan like
        Park Ridge and therefore the Council does have the ability to negotiate from
        a stronger position and try and get a better planning outcome, but still within
        limits.\n\nThe state planning legislation dictates that Council must approve
        residential applications to a density of 15 lots per hectare which on paper
        equates to 633 m2 lots. The reality is that once you remove roads and parks
        from that the lots end up being 450 m2. Once again I reiterate that this is
        not Council planning legislation but state legislation. Yes Council does approve
        these if they tick the state planning boxes but the Council is compelled to
        do this. \n\nAs a Councillor I am personally not a fan of small lots and I
        have argued consistently to have larger lots but I also recognise reality
        that Council cannot stop this.\n\nif you really want to see this thought process
        changed, the state government and the local state MP's have to support changing
        the 15 lots hectare state government legislation which is the biggest challenge.
        I have argued for this and it seems to me that the state government and your
        local state MP also need to hear residents views on this directly as well
        as coming from me.\n\nIn the meantime Council has listened to my concerns
        and those of residents regarding this tidal wave of development occurring
        in the area and within its power, has endorsed drafting a structure plan or
        general planning layout for the Logan Reserve area. When adopted, this plan
        would not stop development of the area but would set out a strategic direction
        and a framework that would strengthen Councils ability to secure better and
        improved roads, more parks and more community facilities. At present it is
        my view that we are struggling to keep pace with this but the ideal of having
        facilities and roads and parks in place before development does not happen
        in reality due to prescriptive over riding legislation. \n\nThere are a lot
        of applications lodged in this area already under the current loose state
        legislation that Council is contending with  but I am doing as best as I can
        along with Councils officers to get these applicants around the table to pro
        - actively seek  more facilities and more improvements that can benefit the
        broader community.\n\nI am happy to discuss further with you and always happy
        to meet with residents to brief or update on what is happening in the area.\n\nKind
        Regards\nPhil"

        along School Road, and also a lot of other local roads. There is unfortunately
        not a lot that can be done to reduce the speed of drivers who are already
        disrespecting the posted speed limits and really have no regard to the local
        community or the people who live in it.\n\nUnfortunately School Road, along
        with Logan Reserve Road are major collector roads and as such they cannot
        have speed humps and the like as they are not in accordance with accepted
        Australian road standards. The posted speed limit along a portion of School
        Road is now down to 60 km/hr and cannot be lwered any further due to the road
        status.\n\nI am all in favour of supporting having properly constructed roundabouts
        and as a result of a recent development, Council had another roundabout constructed
        on School Road at the intersection of Loganview Road. It is quite disturbing
        that despite the efforts to slow drivers down on this road we have a small
        percentage of people that want to disregard the traffic calming and the speed
        limit and have had accidents as a result of this. Council cannot police this
        stupid behaviour and can only put so much concrete and steel in place to try
        and discourage it. \n\nThe roundabout just constructed is very aggressive
        and if this doesn’t slow drivers down, I do not know what will.  \n\nWith
        regards to the planning issues, I am responding to these above and I trust
        that my response will help residents understand some of what is happening.
        \ I am always happy to meet with anyone wo has questions in this and happy
        to come out and sit down with you with what information I have.\n\nKind Regards\nPhil"

      problem. As one of those neighbours at the other end of Myles Avenue, I object
      on these grounds:\r\n\r\n1. High density development in a previously low density
      residential area, resulting in increased noise seven days a week, 24 hours a
      day\r\n2. The two storey buildings will compromise privacy \r\n3. An impact
      on water run off and drainage in an area with a storm water drain and existing
      water issues\r\n4. Shadow impact upon my property due to two storey buildings\r\n5.
      Vulnerable wildlife will be unable to co-exist within the current plan. This
      will not be complementary to Council's very laudable attempts to encourage wildlife
      in backyards\r\n6. The fact that the development is only three metres from my
      fence line, rather than the ten metres on the opposite side which would solve
      many of these issues."

    text: "I am extremely concerned abut the proposed development at 367 Cotham Rd,
      Kew on the corner of Bradford Ave, opposite the Traffic School. (PP16/00548)\r\n\r\nThe
      building, consisting of 31 units over 4 storeys plus 2 levels of underground
      parking is too high at 12.64 metres. With its visual bulk  it would be an unwanted
      addition to the streetscape at the highest point in Kew. It would set a precedent
      for new 4 storey development along Cotham Rd.\r\n\r\nThe development should
      be reduced to 3 storeys and the third storey should be stepped back further
      so that it appears less bulky. This would also reduce overlooking for the several
      properties that abutt the development.\r\n\r\nThe building design and materials
      both need to respect the neighbourhood character of 1 and 2 storey period homes.
      Black fluted concrete is not in keeping with this area. \r\n\r\nOur local amenity
      is under threat.\r\n\r\nI have found useful information about objecting to this

    text: As a council, and community, we need to decide if what we really want is
      for Brisbane Street and the rest of Old Berwick to become a series of high density
      units and townhouses. As a resident and owner of one home and rental home, I
      can confirm that we and other neighbourhood residents want the high density
      to stop. It's ridiculous that developers from Dandenong and other areas can
      divide up the properties to these small sizes and take away character and the
      feeling of community from the town and local residents. High density belongs
      elsewhere not in a town area which is reknowned for it's character and English
      style architecture, plantings and heritage. It's unique in Melbourne and the
      area, we urge to to reconsider developments of this scale. Think beyond rates,
      or you'll have ratepayer flashback to consider. Residents have the right to
      say what character the area should maintain. Protect this jewel of a town.

    text: This is another multi-unit development in an area which is well known for
      it's beautiful streetscapes and country feel. This and other multi-unit developments
      have now started to take away from all the character that is critical to the
      area and City of Casey and create a inner-city feeling in what was a special
      area. We ask that council start considering this in the OLDE BERWICK area before
      it gets any further out of control. Multi-unit developments need to be considered
      in areas outside of OLDE BERWICK unless you want to destroy the town's feeling.
      A better character overlay needs to be created for Old Berwick and removal of
      vegetation should not happen unless it's replaced with substantial European
      or like species. This is in reflection of the area's heritage.

      streets around this area of Edwardstown are character homes.  Other parts of
      Edwardstown less so.  Wish a councillor or employee lived in the area.\r\nSqueeze
      more onto less property whatever the cost.   My concern besides all the destruction
      of history and characters etc is the parking.  I read that 1-2 bedrooms must
      have 1 parking spot.  2-3 - 2 spots.  You honestly think this is right for these
      times?  Two bedrooms - eg parents and child.   3 cars.   If students, a car
      each.  Families who have extended family living with them.  Add another car.
      \  \r\nLength of space for car parking, as it appears that most people do not
      use garage for cars.  eg car parked on driveway with nose of car about 2 inches
      from garage door.  Rear of vehicle 30 plus cms onto footpath.  Large/longer
      vehicles.   This is not a one off - it happens a lot.  Three or more cars and
      at least one has part on footpath.   This small block - facing the beautiful
      Castle St on a corner - so parking will be along Theodore I guess.  \r\nI also
      agree that if there are rules for building that should/must be adhered to.  You
      cannot allow builders/property developers to sway decisions because 'near enough
      is good enough' - it is not.  Nor should council allow decisions to continually
      be okayed because measurements etc are 'close enough'.   "

      Andrew\r\nThe officers have completed assessment of the application, but did
      so during Council's caretaker period. As such, the decision has been made to
      issue a notice of decision to grant a permit; this decision was made under delegation
      without reference to Councillors, per the caretaker provisions. I found out
      about this after the decision was made -- a frustration, but inevitable given
      these election period rules.\r\nI understand that there are further setbacks
      being applied to the 7th and 8th storeys. As an objector, you will be sent a
      letter stating how you can access the terms of the decision (i.e. The conditions
      applied to the permit) and your options to review the decision.\r\n\r\nAll the

      provisions to which Cr Rohan Leppert refers, under which approval has apparently
      been given to developers of 172 Roden Street to double the height restriction.\r\n\r\nI
      can understand the need for caretaker provisions during council elections, but
      do they really give unelected officers such broad license to make approvals
      that massively exceed the planning overlays? The community is increasingly getting
      the impression that the planning overlays mean nothing. It often seems that
      developers treat them as minimums rather than maximums. To have the buck for
      decisions passed to unknown and unaccountable officials does not help community
      confidence in our local government.\r\n\r\nIf it is the case that the officers
      acted within their authority here, can I urge the newly elected council to consider
      reviewing the caretaker provisions? It seems to me that their hand should be
      restrained to approve applications which sit within existing planning guidelines;
      and to force applications for significant exceptions to wait for elected and
      publicly accountable office holders.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMatthew Williams\r\nWest

        the development! Haven't spoken to the developer (and won't) and nor have
        I seen the full plans yet.\n\nThe DDO is reasonably clear, so on the face
        of it the application is pushing the envelope. I'll need to wait for the planning
        officer's assessment before I can express a view on the application and the
        recommended response to that application, but I'll be sure to keep a close
        eye on its progress.\n\nThe Heritage issues are always difficult to predict
        until a full assessment of all aspects of the application are undertaken,
        particularly when the building is in a precinct overlay as this one is. Again,
        I'll keep a close eye on it and scrutinise the recommendation closely.\n\n(This
        application will be assessed in accordance with the planning scheme as it
        is today. The West Melbourne Heritage Review and West Melbourne Structure
        Plan will ultimately change the controls in the area - but this will be after
        this application has been assessed, unfortunately. I am using both the heritage
        and structure plan processes to advocate for finer grain controls, more individualised
        heritage protection, and stronger built form requirements to ensure sensitive
        transition to lower rise and/or heritage residential areas.)\n\nAll the best\n\nrohan\n\n\nCr

        Dear Amy

        Thank you for your post of 12 October 2016 on Planning Alerts regarding the planning application at 1279 North Road Huntingdale for a liquor licence, business signage, reduction of car parking, loading bay and bicycle facilities in association with a cafe and bar.

        Whilst I agree with you that the variety of retail premises contribute to the vibrancy and strength of a shopping centre, Council cannot dictate the mix of commercial activities in a shopping strip.  The conversion of the car park to cafe and shops along with nearby park area with seating for local business workers is a good suggestion, however this needs to be balanced by comments that Council often hears from nearby residents and traders who say that there isn't enough car parking in the Huntingdale Shopping Centre to make it an attractive place to visit, stop and eat for shoppers.  It will be interesting to see how the works that are proposed to this area as part of the Level Crossing Removal Authority's programme of development will impact upon how people use this centre.

        Thank you for sharing your ideas for the Huntingdale Shopping Centre and expressing your passion for a vibrant shopping experience.

        If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact Council's Strategic Planning team, on 9518 3620.

        Regards

    text: "I believe the Hall should remain as it is - a memorial to World War 1 soldiers.
      Should it be converted to a school this memorial will be lost for all time.
      The front contains names of families of long time residents who have since passed.
      This memorial should not be removed just because their families have long passed.
      Although the Hall is probably under utilised at the moment it should not be
      a reason to exclude those that use it now.\r\nThe grounds also include a small
      playground that is used by many because it is fenced off and is very safe for
      small children. I am sure there is a far more appropriate area to locate the
      school - perhaps somewhere within the area where the athletics track is situated.
      Parking is another problem as it is a very busy area during the start and end
      of school days.It is also surrounded by residential properties which I consider
      not appropriate for a school use."

    text: We have already such congestion on Station Road. With two schools, St Leonards
      Primary and Larminier Catholic School, road traffic during pickup and drop off
      times are chaotic. Hardly any curb side parking exists to accommodate the schools
      or home owners cars. Buses and other vehicles trying to squeeze between the
      parked vehicles along with Children and their guardians crossing to and fro
      from school is a death trap waiting to happen. Therefore adding another school
      across the road from St Leonards Primary to join this confusion all ready is
      plain ridiculousness.

    text: "The building was originally approved and constructed as 2 floors. If they
      go up an extra floor it will set a precedent and have a domino effect, and all
      adjacent buildings and streets will also want to add an extra floor.\r\nWhat
      provision are they making for providing extra off street parking. Are they going
      to excavate more parking under the current building. There is already not enough
      on street parking. The middle verge is parkland and not available for parking.
      The RMS wants to remove bus stops in the area so buses are not an option for
      transport and their is no train.\r\nI object to this Development."

        Dear Gabby,

        Thank you for your enquiry. My office has investigated this for you with Council’s relevant departments.

        At this stage no Council upgrades are planned for Logan Reserve for the short to medium term.  Council is however, currently making substantial upgrades to Chambers Flat Road between Bumstead Road and Park Ridge Road to four lanes to help alleviate the traffic issues associated with Yarrabilba.  The upgrades will consists of two north bound and two south bound lanes.  These works are expected to be completed earlier next year.

        Any development applications which are approved on sites fronting onto Logan Reserve Road will need to undertake works necessary to ensure safety of all road users.

        In relation to your comments regarding road noise, any properties located within a designated transport corridor such as Logan Reserve Road is required to comply with the construction requirements identified in the Queensland Development Code - “MP4.4 Building in a transport noise corridor” which is regulated by the Department of Housing and Public Works.

        I hope this sufficiently answers your questions.

        Again, thank you for contacting my office.

        Kind regards,

    text: "Please do not allow this building to be demolished only to build another
      service station. As a heritage building it seems ludicrous to demolish it before
      considering restoration of the building, particularly as there are already six
      different service stations very close to this site, and another one being built
      right next to Bunnings, also on Great Eastern Highway. I actually live on Blackburn
      Street and I can say with absolute conviction that we definitely do not need
      more service stations; anyone in the Midland area can probably find one on their
      doorstep at this rate. For example, anyone wanting to get fuel can easily do
      so at the BP on Great Eastern Highway approximately 100m away, or even at the
      Caltex 200m away. Another service station is hugely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition,
      the residential area surrounding the Darling Range Hotel is an area with only
      two entry points, which are already fairly congested, and the intersection of
      Great Eastern Highway and Horace street is the only way for residents to exit
      right to travel up the hill. Adding a service station will introduce a lot of
      traffic to this area and make it extremely difficult for residents to use the
      Great Eastern Highway & Horace Street intersection, especially at peak hours.
      \r\n\r\nI feel that with the City of Swan's aims to redevelop Midland, keeping
      (or even restoring) the Darling Range Hotel promotes a unique identity that
      could be otherwise lost. The Midland area has a rich history that this hotel
      is notably part of, and removing it would be a waste. The City of Swan has proven
      itself to be more than capable of restoring historic places in Midland, so why
      not go for this option and let Midland be remembered for its many historic areas
      rather than somewhere with a service station on every corner?\r\n\r\n"

    text: "I strongly object to the Kiara Local Structure Plan for Lot 9000 Bottlebrush
      Drive, Kiara (the Plan). Below I have set out the reasons for my objection and
      some suggestions as to how the Plan could be modified to make it more acceptable
      to myself and maybe some of the other existing residents in the area. \r\nMy
      main objection is to the proposed road that will be one of two carrying traffic
      to and from the proposed high school and proposed R30 zoned housing adjacent
      to Chauvel Court. One road intersects with Altone Road (a Distributor A classification).
      The second road however is proposed to intersect with Beckworth Avenue (a Local
      Distributor classification). Beckworth Avenue is a quiet residential street
      between Altone Road and Roseheath Boulevard. This road contains significant
      curves and bends which already cause issues for car owners as they exit driveways.
      By increasing the traffic in Beckworth Avenue the safety to residents will be
      at risk further and the noise pollution will undoubtably increase. I would dispute
      the statement in section 3.4.1 of the Plan that states additional traffic generated
      will only have a minor effect on the operation of the road. As a resident of
      Beckworth Avenue I would be supportive of the Plan if the proposed road instead
      led out to Morley Drive East (a Distributor A classification) and not Beckworth
      Avenue.\r\nThis is the second time in two years where development proposals
      will lead to the decrease in the property value of my home. The first, was the
      placement of a Disability Justice Centre in Lockridge. Turning our quiet street
      into a main thoroughfare will be the second.  The City of Swan Local Planning
      Scheme No. 17 (District Zoning Scheme) claims in 4.2.14 the objectives of the
      Residential Development Zone are to (d) take account of the need to protect
      the amenity and on-going use of adjacent property owners. I do not think the
      Plan supports that objective.\r\nAs the resident of a low density street, zoned
      at R20, I object to being forced to live amongst higher density affordable housing
      (R60/R40) without being offered any of the benefits. Surely if the intention
      is to generate higher density living in the suburb of Kiara the whole of the
      area surrounding the development site should be re-zoned to reflect that. I
      do not believe the Plan is aligned to the City of Swan Local Planning Scheme
      No. 17 (District Zoning Scheme) which states in 4.2.13 the objectives of the
      Residential Zone are to (b) promote a residential environment in each locality
      consistent with the form and density of residential development permissible
      in the locality.\r\nPlease send me the names and contact and submissions from
      the 73 objectors who opposed the Housing Authority proposal to rezone the land
      to ‘Urban’ under the MRS. I would also like to see the full findings of the
      committees set up to consider that proposal and the full WAPC rationale as to
      why 30% of the land could not remain as public open space and included in Bush
      Forever. Clearly further development of the site is intended but is not included
      in the Plan as it stands.  \r\n"

        Elaine

        Thanks for your email. May I ask if you have sent your objection to the City planners?

        The way planning works [I guess you know this] is the state government and local Council set the overall structure plans and local area plans, and then development applications are assessed by the City planners against the plans and zoning. If a DA does not comply, and there are objections, then it is referred to Council with a report. As a Councillor I do not get involved until there is a report from the planners for me to read.

        This Saturday the 8th Oct I am going on a tour of the Altone Ward with the Deputy Mayor, other Councillors and the Place Manager. I will ask to be shown the area of the DA and get a background briefing to place this in context.

        Many other parts of the City of Swan are zoned for much greater density than the current built form. The impact on the lives of residents of redevelopment of their street has been a concern to me for many years (16 years in fact). At the last Council meeting I successfully moved a motion to resolve to refuse such a development in Sayer street Midland that did not comply with the local zoning.

        Your local Altone Ward Councillors are Mick Wainwright (Mayor), David Lucas (Deputy Major) and  David Fardig (Chairman EMRC), so you have the most senior group of Councillors to lobby. I think they have about 70 years' experience between them, whereas I have only one year in office.

        I may have more to say about your email after the tour on Saturday.

        Happy to answer any questions where I can.

        Regards

        Dear John

        Thank you for your email of 2 October regarding proposed amendments to the planning permit issued for the re-development of The Glen Shopping Centre.

        The planning permit system allows applicants to make changes to the planning permission that they have gained for a development.  Where an amendment to the planning permit is considered minor (i.e. an internal rearrangement to layout), the application to amend the planning permit is generally not advertised to surrounding land owners and occupiers.  However, where it is considered that the changes may cause an increase in detriment to any person – say by virtue of the external appearance or scale of an approved building changing – then advertising of the planning application to amend the planning permit is carried out, as is the case with the current planning application for this site, which is currently on advertising.

        As you would appreciate, the acceptance of this planning application to amend the planning permit does not guarantee that permission will be given to the changes that the Permit Applicant proposes.

        Feedback from the community is important.  It assists the focus of assessment in addition to the performance of the application in response to the regulations.  The advice from other departments of Council also assists.

        Thank you for taking interest in this development which will play an important part in directing the future of The Glen and the Glen Waverley Activity Centre.  Your objection to the proposed amendments will be considered as part of the overall assessment.  You will be kept informed of the progress of the application and the outcome.  As with all planning decisions, the decision made by Council in relation to this application for amendments can be reviewed by any party at VCAT.

        Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact Council’s Manager City Planning, Angela Hughes, on 9518 3456.

        Regards
        Geoff

    text: "Dear Phillip,\r\nThank you for spending time with us last night, it was
      appreciated.  \r\nFor your reference, here is a copy of the objection that we
      submitted to Council today.\r\nYours, Wendy & Terry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We would like
      to object to the proposed development “PP16/00521” at 15 Park Lane, Kew.\r\n\r\nWe
      live in Park Lane and feel the proposed development would have an adverse impact
      upon our lifestyle, our family, our visitors, our neighbours, the park users,
      the local community, the neighbourhood, and us.\r\n\r\nOur objections to the
      proposed development include - but are not limited to – the following areas
      of concern.\r\n\r\nACCESS\r\nSAFETY\r\nPARKING\r\nWASTE MANAGEMENT\r\nVISUAL
      BULK\r\nLOSS OF NEIGHBOURHOOD CHARACTER\r\nOVER-DEVELOPMENT\r\nCONTRARY TO COUNCIL
      AND OTHER GUIDELINES\r\nPOOR APPLICATION PLUS MISLEADING/INACCURATE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nPark
      Lane is a single width (3.048 metres, narrowing to 2.7 metres in places) laneway
      which gives primary street access to 13 properties plus 2 corner properties
      and the properties at 311 Barkers Road also have vehicle access. \r\n\r\nThere
      is no signed speed restriction in Park Lane, even though it is a shared carriageway.
      \ There is no street lighting, other than that currently provided by the owners
      of numbers 1 to 10 Park Lane.\r\n\r\nLarge vehicles cannot negotiate the bend
      at the South East corner of Park Lane.  Large vehicles, and some cars, reverse
      back into either Malin Street or Fitzwilliam Street.  Council has conceded some
      of the parkland to assist access into and out of the junction of Park Lane with
      Fitzwilliam Street. The boundary fence has also been set back into the park
      outside the subject property for a distance in excess of 15 metres for a depth
      of over 3 metres.  This has left the old Red River Gum exposed to traffic damage.
      \ Public parkland should not be given over for private use.  Properties should
      be required to fully accommodate their access within their own property boundary.
      \ The public parkland boundary should be re-instated.\r\n\r\nThere is no footpath
      in Park Lane.  Pedestrians, bikes, and motor vehicles share Park Lane.  \r\n\r\nA
      number of Park Lane residents are elderly and use mobility aids.  They are not
      able to move out of the way of traffic easily, or quickly.\r\n\r\nPark Lane
      borders Kellett Reserve, which has a children’s playground.  Young children
      often ride their bikes and scooters around Park Lane and on the path within
      Kellett Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe park is well used by local residents, families,
      dog-walkers, the local child-care centre, kindergartens, schools, etc.  Being
      in a busy school area, the park is especially busy at school pick up times.
      \ \r\n\r\nOn a number of occasions we have witnessed dangerous situations between
      vehicles and children, thankfully we have not seen anyone hurt.\r\n\r\n15 properties
      are situated on Park Lane and 13 have their main, or sole, entrance on Park
      Lane, these are numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17 & 19 Park Lane.\r\n\r\nNumbers
      1-10 Park Lane have double garages at the rear of their properties accessed
      by a private rear driveway which 5.74 metres wide.  This allows for 2-way traffic,
      heavy vehicles and loading.  There are 9 spaces at the front of their properties,
      accessed via Park Lane, which can be used by their visitors, with another visitor
      space at the rear.  Number 13 Park Lane has provision for 3 cars on site and
      both number 17 and 19 have a single garage each, with a pull in.  Vehicle use
      of Park Lane could increase from the current 6 resident’s vehicles (2@No.13,
      2@No.15, 1@No.17 & 1@No.19) to 24 resident’s vehicles.  Excluding visitor cars,
      this is a massive 400% increase in traffic by one property out of the 13 properties
      in Park Lane.\r\n\r\nParking in Fitzwilliam and Malin Streets is becoming progressively
      more difficult for local residents, their visitors and park users.  Fitzwilliam
      Street can be difficult to navigate, especially during school drop-off and pick-up
      times.  Properties in Barkers Road, with insufficient parking, use Malin Street
      as Barkers Road has restrictions.  Students also use Malin Street, as there
      are no permit or time restrictions.  \r\n\r\nRubbish bin congestion is a problem
      at both ends of Park Lane, as the collection vehicles cannot negotiate the width,
      or bend, of Park Lane.  The 4 properties on the Fitzwilliam side of Park Lane
      currently put their rubbish bins (up to 12 of them) at their junction with Fitzwilliam
      Street.  The proposed development allows for 20 bins, with extra bins to be
      purchased if necessary.  The report does not show any allowance for green waste
      bins.  Fitzwilliam Street does not have a nature strip, so bins are placed on
      the footpath.  When these bins fall over (which does happen) mothers with prams,
      pedestrians and children have to negotiate around them.  The 10 properties on
      the other side of Park Lane put their bins (up to 30 of them) at their junction
      with Malin Street. \r\n\r\nThe visual bulk of the proposed development would
      dominate the streetscape.  It is unsympathetic to the character of the neighbourhood.
      \ \r\nThe proposal is an over-development of an existing single dwelling in
      a pleasant residential area.  The subject property was previously sub-divided
      off a property in Wrixon Street in 1977.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed 32-bedroom complex
      has little outdoor space for physical activity.  If fully occupied, 64 additional
      users may access the park on a regular basis.  The park could struggle to accommodate
      this number of additional users without an upgrade and increase in equipment.
      \r\n\r\nPark Lane could struggle to cope with the number of proposed additional
      vehicles.  There could be frequent occasions where one vehicle has to reverse
      the length of the park to allow another vehicle to enter/exit.  This would put
      cyclists and pedestrians, especially the young and the elderly, at grave risk.
      \ \r\n\r\nThe ambience of the area is due, in part, by this old lane with its
      bluestone central strip.  Such an increase in traffic (especially during construction)
      could also cause stress and damage to the trees at the edge of the park.  Due
      to the trees proximity to Park Lane, vehicles have physically impacted some
      of them.  Large vehicles and construction vehicles will impose a greater risk
      of this occurring.  There are a number of possums and a variety of birds that
      live in and visit the park.  Nocturnal birds such as Tawny Frogmouths and owls
      are also frequent visitors and nest in the area.\r\n\r\nThere are other properties
      in Wrixon Street that have rear tennis courts bordering Park Lane.  A development
      of this density could create a precedent for these properties to also be sub-divided
      and more apartments developed, exacerbating the problems, and further increasing
      the traffic using Park Lane.  \r\n\r\nThe subject property is in a GRZ1 Zone,
      which is suitable for “one to two storey, detached dwellings, dual occupancy
      and multi-unit villa/townhouse developments.”  The proposal is for a three storey
      (plus underground car park) apartment building, which is acceptable in GRZ2/3
      Zones.  \r\n\r\nThe subject property is in Precinct 16.  The ‘Preferred Character
      Statement’ says, “To maintain and enhance the single storey historic character
      of the precinct.”  Under ‘Building Height and Form” it says, “To ensure buildings
      do not dominate the streetscape or disrupt the existing streetscape rhythm.”
      \ The proposal does not meet these objectives.\r\n\r\nAdvertising of this proposal
      was by way of a sign on the front fence and letters to the adjoining properties.
      \ Other properties in Park Lane were not notified, even though they will be
      impacted and suffer from increased traffic density.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number
      of areas of concern, failure to meet guidelines, inaccuracies, and misleading
      information, included in the Advertising application: \r\n\r\nREPORT - Sustainable
      Management Plan\r\n\r\n6.2 Design Principles – ‘Public Transport’ states “2.00km
      to Gardiner Train Station” – this station is 5.3 km away.\r\n\r\n12.0 Appendix
      A – ‘Disclaimer’ references Moreland City Council.\r\n\r\nEnergy - There is
      no provision for clothes drying.\r\n\r\nREPORT - Traffic Report\r\n\r\n3.2 Road
      Network.\r\n“Park Lane has a carriageway width of approximately 3m in the vicinity
      of the site and approximately 4.2m in the vicinity of Malin Street acting as
      a shared lane for traffic flow in both directions.”  This is incorrect.  Park
      Lane is approximately 3m for its entire length.  Whilst measuring Park Lane
      for this report the writer was informed, and shown the boundary between Park
      Lane and the property owned by numbers 1 to 10 Park Lane.  They chose to ignore
      this information and included the area of private property as being part of
      Park Lane.  There is no ability for traffic to flow in both directions in any
      area of Park Lane. \r\n“Photographs depicting Claire Street are presented in
      Figure 5 and Figure 12”  This is incorrect – The Streets shown are Park Lane,
      Fitzwilliam Street and Malin Street.  Where is Claire Street?\r\n3.3 Traffic
      Conditions\r\nThe periods counted were 8am-9am and 5pm-6pm.  Situated on Kellett
      Reserve in a busy school area the peak traffic use for this area is 3pm-5pm
      on school days with frequent use at weekends.\r\n3.4 Car Parking Conditions\r\nThe
      4th April was during the school holidays.  The times of 8am, 10am, 12 noon &
      1pm avoid the busy school pick-up times and weekend family park trips. \r\n4.3
      Parking Layout and Access Arrangement\r\nClause 52.06-8 Design Standard 3 –
      Gradients.  The proposal does not meet the guidelines.  The report argues that
      as access is via a laneway/ROW that does not include a footpath, and has low
      pedestrian volume they consider it satisfactory with no adverse safety impact.
      \ Park Lane is the primary street frontage for 13 properties.  The park attracts
      a large number of children, many of whom ride their bikes and scooters around
      Park Lane.  A number of people use Park Lane for walking, including those with
      mobility impairment.\r\n4.4 Waste Collection & Loading Requirements\r\n\r\nWaste
      collection has not been adequately addressed.  The proposal offers ‘Waste collection
      arrangements can be formalised by a Waste Management Plan and could be included
      as a condition of granting a permit.’  A waste management plan has been included
      in the application.\r\n\r\nThe proposal states that ‘Any loading activities
      associated with the apartments will be accommodated on-street in the nearby
      area.’  The developer acknowledges in 3.2 that Fitzwilliam Street is only 8m
      wide, has parking on both sides, and only allows for a shared lane for two-way
      traffic.  Impositions of large vehicles using this area for loading would be
      disruptive, cause congestion, and be dangerous to the many children who access
      the neighbouring schools in this area.\r\n\r\n4.5.1 Traffic Generation Rates\r\n\r\nThe
      proposal suggests that the development will generate 60 vehicle trips per day,
      a massive increase in the current usage.  Consideration has not been given to
      the fact that this is not a typical ROW.  It is the primary street for 14 of
      properties.  It surrounds a popular local park.  Children and the elderly, walkers
      and runners, bike and scooter riders and also occasional cars commonly use Park
      Lane.  The safety of children is a real concern that must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nREPORT
      - Planning Report\r\n\r\nThe proposed maximum building height is 10 metres with
      services and lift overrun located on the roof.  We could see no height recorded
      for the service and lift overrun.  The report argues that the 9 metre maximum
      may be exceeded due to the slope of the land.  The visual impact is not diminished
      by this argument.\r\n\r\nExisting Character\r\nReferencing other properties
      in Park Lane the report states, “All are two storeys in height”.  This is incorrect.
      \ Numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 are single storey.  Numbers 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15,
      17 & 19 are two storey.  \r\n\r\nThe report also states “Front setbacks are
      narrow (in the order of 3.5 metres).”  This is incorrect.  Numbers 1 to 10 Park
      Lane all have a setback in excess of 7 metres.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the
      proposal for 3 storeys the report argues that due to the sites location on a
      park it is ‘somewhat secluded’ from other properties.  To the contrary, as it
      is situated on a park it is more visible to more people and therefore the bulk
      is more obtrusive.\r\n\r\n55.03-3 Site Coverage\r\nThis does not comply, the
      building site coverage is in excess of 60%\r\n\r\n55.03-9 Access\r\nVehicle
      access covers 66% of the site frontage, exceeding the 33% allowed.  The report
      states, “within Park Lane it is not uncommon for vehicular access ways to take
      up approx. 60% of the site frontage”.  This is incorrect – the maximum access
      for numbers 1 to 10 Park Lane covers 34.9% of their individual frontages, and
      even less in total.\r\n\r\nVehicle and bicycle access is via ramps that exceed
      the recommended gradient.  This gradient, with a maximum of 1:4 or 25% would
      be extremely difficult, and potentially dangerous, to negotiate on foot and
      especially so with a bicycle.\r\n\r\n55.04-8 Noise impacts\r\nThe report states
      no significant noise impact.  An increase from 1 dwelling to 10 generates extra
      general people noise, extra vehicle movements, garage doors will open/close
      an estimated 60 times a day, the hum of multiple air-conditioners (12 compressors
      are shown on the roof), especially overnight, will add to the noise impact.\r\n\r\n55.05-2
      Dwelling Entry\r\n“Assessment: the building has been designed to front Park
      Lane with a secure entry lobby via Fredrick Street presenting a clear and proud
      sense of address.”  This is incorrect.  Where is Fredrick Street?\r\n\r\n55.05-5
      Solar access to open space\r\nThe proposal does not comply\r\n\r\n55.05-6 Storage\r\nThe
      proposal does not comply\r\n\r\nWe do not agree with the planning report conclusion:
      \ \r\n“The proposal has been appropriately designed to respect the emerging
      character of the area; to minimise impacts on the amenity of the area and to
      ensure an appropriate level of amenity for future occupants.”\r\n\r\nREPORT
      - Waste Management Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposal states that once a week all bins
      (20 +) will be taken from the bin store via the ramp to ‘the footpath in Park
      Lane’ for collection by Council’s waste collection.  This is incorrect.  There
      is NO footpath in Park Lane.  Council does NOT collect from Park Lane, as it
      is too narrow.  The ramp exceeds the recommended gradient and at its maximum
      is 1:4 or 25%.  This gradient would be extremely difficult to negotiate on foot.
      \ It is potentially extremely dangerous to require an individual to also push
      a rubbish bin either up or down a ramp this steep.\r\n\r\nREPORT - Daylight
      Analysis\r\n\r\nModel parameters\r\nAll external apartment glazing was assumed
      to be “clear single glazing”\r\nSustainable Management 2.4 Window & Glazing
      states “a combination of single and double glazing”.  How will these figures
      be impacted if the windows are double-glazed?  \r\nThe parameters also assume
      all paint and floor covering are predominately white or medium coloured.  Will
      this be a condition of ownership?\r\n\r\nREPORT - Application Form and Title\r\n\r\nPage
      2 of the title of the property marked LEGEND, item number 2 states, “the lower
      boundary of each of these units is four metres below that part of the site.\r\n\r\nIt
      would appear from the plans that this 4 metre limit may have been exceeded.
      \ Would this mean that part of this development is proposed to be built on land
      that it does not own?\r\n\r\nREPORT - Arborist Report\r\n\r\n3.8  This report
      acknowledges that the TPZ’s of three large trees in Kellett reserve will be
      impacted by encroachments of approx. 11.9%, 18.7% and 13% by the proposed basement
      ramps.  This report suggests that a non-destructive root investigation could
      confirm the potential impact if Council deemed it necessary.  We believe this
      should be done, for the safety and protection of these trees.  Other trees at
      the edge of Kellett reserve have not been acknowledged.  Heavy construction
      vehicles could impact these trees and we believe that all trees within a 5 metre
      distance Park Lane should be protected during the construction period.\r\n\r\nREPORT
      - Plans and photomontages\r\n\r\nNotations on the first photograph of the area
      are incorrect.  1-10 Park Lane is shown as a double storey townhouse development.
      \ This is incorrect - 4 of the properties are double storey, but 6 properties
      are single storey.  \r\n\r\nWhere is David Street?  Davis Street Kindergarten
      is approx. 400 metres away.  (This has been incorrectly repeated as Davi"

    text: "Dear Judith\r\n\r\nWe have sent the following objection, via Boroondara's
      online objection portal.  However as our local councillor, we thought you might
      appreciate a copy as well.\r\n\r\nOBJECTION – PP16/00521\r\n\r\nWe object to
      the proposed three storey (plus basement) multi-unit dwelling to be built at
      15 Park Lane, Kew – it is comprised of eight (8) three bedroom apartments and
      two (2) four bedroom apartments, all of which will over look Kellet Reserve;
      as well as the provision of parking for thirty-three (33) cars.\r\nThis development
      does not respect our neighbourhood character, the amenity of neighbours and
      will create unreasonable visual bulk.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, this multi-unit
      dwelling is an inappropriate development within Boroondara’s Precinct 16 – our
      local area.  Our reasons include the following.\r\n\r\nAccess to this property
      is only via the “L” shaped blue stone laneway (Park Place) which borders the
      public park and playground, known as “Kellet Reserve”. \r\n\r\nIn the Council’s
      Precinct 16 document, it says… “ensuring new developments … respect the predominant
      building scale and forms of the streetscape.”  This proposed development is
      totally “out of neighbourhood character” – there are no multi-unit dwellings
      of this size within our local neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nA “threat” identified in
      the same document are “buildings (that) appear bulky and ‘box’ like”.  With
      the limited “private open space” within this multi-unit dwelling, the removal
      of all the current trees and the proposed building’s enormous footprint, we
      would describe this development as “bulky and ‘box’ like”.  \r\n\r\nAnother
      identified “threat” includes the ‘carparking structure’ of a development – this
      multi-unit dwelling does not minimize its carparking structure.  Instead, it
      is proposed there will be two ‘crossovers’ erected to access the property via
      the laneway.  These two crossovers will be constructed as “splayed”, as the
      architect has identified the difficulty residents will have to maneuver their
      vehicles in and out of the property.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is no provision
      of any ‘loading bay’ in the basement.  The suggestion is that any loading bay
      activities will performed “on-street”.  Given the nearest on-street is quite
      a distance away, should the loading/unloading be undertaken outside the property,
      the laneway would be blocked for its duration.  \r\nThe laneway is too narrow
      for the council’s waste trucks to enter.  So all ten (10) rubbish bins, all
      ten (10) recycle bins (and possibly all ten (10) green bins) will need to be
      transported to Fitzwilliam Street, for the weekly waste collection. \r\n\r\nThe
      traffic survey did not take into account any use of the public park and recreation
      zone by local residents during a weekend.  This is when most families access
      our local park and playground.\r\n\r\nThis traffic survey suggested a conservative
      estimate of the multi-unit development traffic would be six (6) vehicle trips,
      per day, per unit.  This equates to sixty (60) trips up and down a single lane
      laneway, which has no separate footpath.  The laneway (Park Place) is not a
      private right of way and is also used by other residents.\r\n\r\nThe trees in
      Kellet Reserve could also be impacted by this proposed development.  In particular
      the mature River Red Gum, which has been described as only in “fair” health,
      as have the two Turkish Pines.  The effect of the many construction vehicles
      and the delivery of the construction materials have a detrimental impact on
      Kellet Reserve, which would be hard to restore.\r\n\r\nWe are also concerned
      that the noise level from the carport’s ventilation system and the operation
      of at least twelve (12) airconditioning units will affect the amenity of park
      users and the neighbouring properties.\r\n\r\nShould this multi-unit dwelling
      development go ahead, the character of our neighbourhood will be severely spoiled.
      \ As long time residents and rate payers we would hope our interests will be
      represented by our Council and not the interests of the developers.\r\n"

        Dear Keith



        I have received advice from Council's Development Planning Manager that the stub road does not connect to the existing Kurrajong Sanctuary development, but rather the adjoining parcel of land.  Further advice is that the application did not include the Kurrajong Sanctuary site.  The plan of development below shows an access to the development from Creek Road.

        Please contact my office if I can be of any further assistance.

    text: If higher density living is to be encouraged then 1. Apartments should be
      mandatorily advertised as 'no garage/car space' living. So it is transparent

      be a network of (family) safe, separated cycleways, flyover bike/pedestrian  bridges,

        parcel 2-16 Wynyard Street, Cleveland workshopped by Council throughout 2014.
        This was followed by a Council resolution for the land to be transferred to
        Council to Redland Investment Corporation (RIC), on 10 December 2014. This
        site was transferred as it was identified as land that had the potential to
        generate a positive financial outcome to Council and the community, while
        providing stimulus for the rejuvenation of the Cleveland CBD Revitalisation
        Strategy and economic uplift. \n\nAn independent valuation was carried out
        to determine market value. The property was offered for sale, with three companies
        expressing and interest and making an offer to purchase. The company, which
        ended up purchasing the land was a willing buyer prepared to offer above market
        value to meet the requirement of his business and inject millions into our
        local economy. The local company that purchased the site, LJ Hooker, plans
        to establish a new office complex. It will provide the company with the opportunity
        to generate local employment in our community, while growing their business.
        This is a reflection of the confidence the company has for the growth in not
        just Cleveland, but the wider Redland economy\n\nThe company’s move to the
        new building will free-up car bays within the Cleveland CBD, with additional
        parking bays to be added at the Redland Performing Arts Centre."

        This response from officers re offsets:

        The offset requirements for the trees classified as Non-Juvenile Koala Habitat Trees is mandated by State Government policy and legislation, as Koalas are a Matter of State Environmental Significance. The relevant legislation and planning policy is the Environmental Offsets Act and the South East Queensland Koala Conservation State Planning Regulatory Provisions.

        An applicant has the option of either a financial contribution, onsite offset or a combination of the two. For the development at 2-6 Wynyard Street it is still yet to be confirmed how the offset will be managed. An onsite offset may not be possible. If there is a financial contribution, the amount is paid to Council to administer in a trust account to undertake delivery of an offset (typically this would be conservation or open space land where offset planting will enhance koala habitat).

        Hello Brian,
        Thank you for the prompt,
        Regarding the sale process, I can report it was an off market/competitive sales campaign carried out by Redlands Investment Corporation, owned by RCC for the benefit of the Community.
        I understand they achieved a record sale price for land in the CBD in this negotiation.
        Regarding more detailed "offset" information
        As my prior response indicated, the offsets for this development had not been finalised when you last enquired.
        I will once more enquire for you with officers on this matter.

      your figure of Hookers requiring 40 spaces and added a conservative 10 more
      to cover the cafe and offices that will be part of the development.  The building
      itself occupies numerous former car spaces as well.  The overall lose of parking
      in this busy area really is senseless.  Making it all worse, I note that the
      architect's plans only indicate 31 on-site car parks for the development which
      means their inevitable overflow will take more of the few remaining spaces left
      available to the public.  \r\nI will look forward to hearing of your investigation

      I hope you can answer for me.\r\n\r\nYou mention freeing up 40 parking spaces,
      but won't these be used by whatever business takes over the existing Hooker
      office?  Also it appears that the Hooker building/cafe/offices has on site parking
      for themselves meaning overall nearly 50 car parks will be lost to those wanting
      to patronise businesses in the eastern part of the CBD.\r\n\r\nAnd I must say
      that removing koala significant trees and only getting a financial offset is
      not helping the environment at all.  But how much money will be made available
      for environmental matters directly from this sale and how and when will it be
      made available?\r\n\r\nI would also like to know more of the sale process.  Why
      was this particular piece of well used public property chosen to be sold off?
      \ How was the land valued - was there an independent valuation?  Was the land
      offered for sale or put out for tender to the market?  If not, how was it determined
      that the sale price was market value when, as it appears, only one company was
      given the opportunity to purchase it? \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from

If there is a financial contribution, the amount is paid to Council to administer in a trust account to undertake delivery of an offset (typically this would be conservation or open space land where offset planting will enhance koala habitat).

      off public parking, that is heavily used, for commercial development.  The parking
      proposed at the community centre is not, in any way, a reasonable replacement.\r\nHowever
      as it is going ahead I would ask you to intervene with regard to the identified
      koala trees that are to be removed.  The proposed \"offsets\" are melaleucas,
      not a tree that is an appropriate replacement food tree for the brush box trees
      being destroyed.\r\nCould you please insist that koala food trees are used?\r\nThanks\r\nBrian

      text: "Hello Brian,\nThanks for getting in touch.\nThe development will indeed
        lose about 20 net car parks at this site site.\nIt will however free up 40
        existing staff parks around the cbd for the business moving to the site.\nThe
        extra parks at RPAC are just one option from some of the proceeds of the sale
        into council (for the benefit of ratepayers) pockets.\nIf the car parks are
        added at RPAC, these are still quite handy to the CBD I believe, but do \"shuffle
        the deck chairs\" a little. I am happy to discuss this further with you.\nThe
        offset for the trees needing to be  removed is purely a financial payment
        and so this money can be used in a strategic way for the environment, rather
        than a specific place or tree species. \nThis flexibility may produce a better
        outcome as you suggest.\nPeter Mitchell\n"

    text: 'As a person who just purchased the property behind this house (24 hill
      parade) I am concerned with this development. Should the property be sub divided
      chances are someone will build 2 storey narrow houses on each block. My concern
      is that at present, I have water views from my kitchen window, should this occur
      I will in turn loose my water views and de value my property '

    text: " I'm opposed to the application 4 the over 55 residents at 7 Beach Street
      Woolgoolga.\r\n The reason I'm objecting to this development is because we are
      losing the village atmosphere that people want in Woolgoolga  Coffs Harbour
      Council seems to think everybody needs to be multi storey people come to Woolgoolga
      and love the village because there aren't many seaside villages left. We dont
      want our village to become over developed and it is absolutely unnecessary,
      there are other areas in Woolgoolga that can have multi-storey buildings please
      leave our village alone keep the village at Woolgoolga it is well renowned for
      it character."

      \        \r\nWe strongly object to the proposed  'Seniors housing / Retirement
      village' being developed at 14 Halyard Way, Belmont.  In November 2014 we purchased
      our current residence at 11 The Maindeck, Belmont due to the serenity, surrounding
      bushland, birdlife and outlook of the property, being of retirement age we would
      definitely find a forced move to relocate because of the proximity of this development
      to our residence extremely difficult.  The area (bushland) at the rear of our
      property is used by ourselves, and other locals, to enjoy a quiet walk through
      the bush with our grandchildren (who being from a totally residential suburb
      without bushland) find the area extremely educational and peaceful.  Another
      concern would be the access in and out of this development with the local streets
      already being too narrow for larger vehicles, currently when entering and leaving
      if a resident (or visitor) is parked on the street in front of their property
      it is required to drive on the other side of the roadway to pass, larger vehicles
      in the area would be a recipe for disaster of families (with young children)
      living in the local streets.  We invite anyone with interest in this development
      to come and see the number of birds (on a daily basis) that come to our backyard
      or just sit on our back fence, has it been considered at all about where they
      may relocate to after their home territory is destroyed by development and noise!!!"

      past 20 yrs or so his wife died in 2001, after that time Dennis lived their
      the property was not much then so you can imagine the state of it at the moment.
      Dennis got sick with kidney disease and passed away in May of this year I'm
      sure that property contributed to his health issues. The church took 250 dollars
      a week of Dennis and the property was not fit for human habitation, after Dennis
      passed away I went to the property to pick up some of his things and I got the
      shock of my life to see the state of this so called house. I realised then why
      he was so sick.the church should have been paying him to stay in that horrible
      place.RIP Dear Dennis.if that place had have been demolished 10 years ago Dennis
      would have been still alive.to the Luthern church have a look in the mirror
      and tell me what you see.

    text: "Dear Councillor,\r\n\r\nThese are my comments on the proposed development
      in Simon Street,\r\n\r\nThe  frontages of some  of the lots in this proposed
      development are very much narrower that all existing lots that open on to Simon
      Street. Also the size of the some of the proposed lots appears to be  small,
      certainly smaller than any existing lots contiguous to Simon Street. The new
      proposal could  give a higher density housing appearance to a mature neighbourhood
      where established homes currently have a  more spacious appearance.  \r\n\r\nAlso
      I suspect that most new house holders and their families will have several cars
      and I can see that parking on a narrow street like Simon Street could be problematic
      in future, unless sufficient off-road parking is provided on each property.\r\n\r\nThe
      plan should be improved by reducing the number of dwellings. \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,
      David Birtwhistle, 6 Cam Court, Victoria Point "

      There is a marked increase in population in the area and the narrowness of the

      undesirable to increase the number of drinkers on public space.

      It will transform the court from what is a quiet family friendly area to a high

    text: "Can you please provide more information on how the local primary/high schools
      are going to cope with the increase of students due to the development application
      for this area.\r\nAs my previous concerns have been raised, of the continued
      carve up of acreage land into very small residential blocks, local communities
      are at the risk of being sold out to investors buying up to then put the houses
      on the rental market.\r\n\r\nDevelopers seem to only have to provide very limited
      infrastructure and the increase in traffic on already very poor roads is certainly
      going to make it a whole lot worse.\r\n\r\nI have lived and worked in this area
      for 23 years and feel very strongly about where development of this nature is
      heading. I will await a reply from a council representative to contact me on

        Mel. Sorry, but the news is bad. As a Council we have almost no control over "development'" if it meets the site size criteria, etc.
        Almost all of our powers have been stripped away by the State Government.
         I share your dismay at the disappearance of our heritage-style items, but the Government
         want us to increase the population of Unley by 5000..

        Hi David,

        As discussed on numerous occasions, if an application conforms to the zoning rules there is very little that staff or elected councillors can do to alter this. If you have objections they need to be made on planning grounds. I'm not trying to be negative but there is little i can do. We have raised the issue of storm water management which was the basis of your concerns about over development and some mitigation measures have been undertaken and are being undertaken.

        Happy to discuss if you want to give me a call.

        Regards,

        Barney

        Hi Barbara,

        As explained at our meeting, if an application conforms to the planning rules then there is little that staff or elected councillors can do. Stormwater management is required to be managed under the terms of any DA.

        Your concerns need to be addressed via a flood management study and plan (currently being undertaken) and/or at a DCP or even LEP level. Hopefully the new council can look into this.

        Regards,

        Barney

        Subject: Planning application at 40 Lachlan Road, Cardiff NSW 2285

        There seems to be little thought put into existing infrastructure ,last major rain event
        There was sewage over flowing in the street ,also I had flooding through my garage
        This has never happened before, the rubber stamping of applications has to be stopped and genuine research done ,
        Flooding in general has always been a serious problem in our area  it seems both hunter water and Lake Macquarie council are not doing there jobs .once capacity has been reached with regards to storm water significant infrastructure has to be constructed,
        As the catch cry of both Hunter water and Lake Macquarie council is "We have no money" perhaps developments need to be put on hold till they can fix the problem!

    text: I thought that the Monash Council was cracking down of twin houses being
      built on land that held only one property. Jubilee Street is a very narrow street
      with many new double units on previously single dwelling propping up all the
      time. There is limited garage spaces for these types of units and many cars
      are parked on this narrow road. To permit a 3 double storey dwelling on this
      small land which held only one property begs belief. The entire road from High
      Street (through Park road to Jubilee Road) to Highbury road is all turning in
      to a multi 2 to 3 unit dwellings where there was only one property in each land
      making it a very densely populated stretch of road.

      the Northern Policy Area 13 document implies that row dwellings need to meet
      a minimum of 250m2 and I have been advised/measured these blocks to be 242.8m2
      each???\r\nI hope that the buildings actually meet the minimum policy stipulations
      and don't cause any safety issues for neighbouring houses when reversing onto
      Chitral Tce.\r\nI understand the State Development policies had changed a while
      back, but that doesn't mean the the governing council doesn't have the right
      to reject these land divisions that don't meet minimum sizes.\r\nRegards"

        Dear Kym,

        Thank you for your enquiry.

        I appreciate that on face value, dwellings on land less than the minimum site area should not be supported.

        The Development Plan, however, comprises only guidelines for development. I acknowledge there is a popular misconception that the DP is a set of rules. On the contrary, State legislation guides planning authorities toward approving proposals, even those falling short of quite specific "requirements" of the DP so long as they are not at significant variance from the Plan. Thus each guiding principle of the DP is not a 'hard and fast' rule; rather, for most applications, if the weight of the complying features outweigh the deficient features, the application will gain Planning Consent!

        This regime leads to many disappointed residents, but there you have it - we are bound by State law.

        I have been advised that in this particular case the shortfall in site area was considered relatively minor, and the design of the dwellings met a majority of applicable design criteria. In this regard, the merits of the proposal were such that Development Plan approval was warranted.

        In terms of safety for reversing vehicles, I am advised that each dwelling now faces Chitral Terrace, which means it is highly likely the existing fencing along the Chitral Street frontage of the property will be removed. Combined with the removal of the galvanised shed which is adjacent to your property sightlines may improve looking north along Chitral Terrace when you are reversing out of your property. I have been advised that with respect to fencing between your properties, the location, height, length and costs are civil matters that are not the jurisdiction of Council (unless the fence exceeds 2.1 metres in height). You may wish to raise your concerns regarding safety with the property owner when the time comes to discussing any new/replacement fencing.

        Dear Mr. Sykes,

        Thank you for your email dated the 30/9/16.

        I wish to advise that the Sunshine Coast Council and its planning officers are recommending a refusal of the current Bunning's development application. I will be supporting this refusal motion.

        Kind regards,

        Christian

      here, we want to preserve some of what is left of our town while we still can.
      Just because they own the land does not give them the right to bypass the existing

    text: "Gosford Council is using current legislation to approve any development
      that is submitted. They claim and advertise their commitment to the community,
      I believe their only commitment is to the development community and not the
      community or environment at large, The supporting submissions lodged with the
      development application would to the casual reader appear to be compliant, but
      are they? The application should not only meet the demands of current legislation
      but should also plan for the future (nine one bedroom units (boarding house)
      and its current design do little to enhance the aesthetics of this wonderful
      suburb. Whilst there is nine units there appears to be a deficiency in parking
      provisions.The surrounding streets are narrow and street parking prohibits smooth
      travelling through these streets, and Council is providing footpath parking
      for residents in some areas. The existing structure over the years has not been
      maintained and has become derelict, a new building would improve this situation
      but a nine one bedroom boarding house should not have been considered, but may
      advantage the developer to over capitalise on this site.\r\nPerhaps Council
      could negotiate a better use with  the developer to enhance the area and still
      return a profit to the developer. A boarding house is not considred an appropriate
      use or development of this site."

      the weekend.\r\nObviously there is some conjecture flying around in the absence
      of information so thought I would take the time to provide you with some more
      detailed information until you have the opportunity to view the drawings yourself.\r\n
      \r\nThe current proposal is to maintain the ground floor and first floor as
      the pub. The current area to the rear which is not utilised, just storage, shady
      beer garden and lean-to toiles is to be developed into a well-considered infill
      development of standalone townhouses, not apartments.\r\n \r\nThe development
      of this unused parcel of land will enable me to repair the existing pub and
      maintain its viability into the future ensuring it lives into the future and
      not be sold off to developers.\r\nI have run and lived in the pub for 19 years
      and of all people could think of nothing more heartbreaking than seeing it turned
      into another development.\r\n \r\nIn addition to this I am proposing a single
      apartment above the ridgeline for myself.\r\n \r\nAs you may or may not be aware
      of Hardimans is in dire need of some serious repairs that can no longer be fixed
      with a band aid solution. This proposal is a commercial venture which sole purpose
      is to ensures the future of the pub. I therefore feel our goals, the local residents
      and councils are all in parallel and hopefully can garnish your support to ensure
      the heritage fabric of Kensington is maintained not just for the foreseeable
      time but well into the future.\r\n \r\nRick Richards\r\nHardimans Hotel"

        have heritage implications, yes.\n\nMore significantly though Hardimans is
        in a Commercial Zone, so while residential uses are permitted there would
        need to be a strong case made to convert the entire building to residential
        apartments, one would have thought. The ground floor in particular is meant
        to remain for Commercial uses under the zone, but these things are discretionary.
        I haven't seen plans yet so don't want to preempt a proper assessment, and

        if this comes to Council I'm not allowed to express a view on the application

        potential loss of a local venue that has a track record of supporting live

      HIGHER than the Quest apartments currently under construction?\r\nIs the removal
      of trees necessary? They are used ALL the time by workers in the area as a shady

        Hi Stephanie and Graham
        Thank you for your email - and especially your support for maintaining heritage in the Port.
        Unfortunately this development, along with the Quest Apartments, has been classified as a state development and is considered and approved by the (state government) Development Assessment Commission, not Council. Developments over $3m are now automatically taken out of our hands and under the new Planning legislation, it looks like councils will have even less influence in ensuring community feedback is taken into account.
        If you are interested in this issue I encourage you to join the Port of Adelaide Branch of the National Trust, who have been campaigning around this for some time - the website will give you the details.
        I appreciate your concern and will continue to advocate on heritage and the natural environment issues within the council.


        Kind regards,
        Michelle

      a mother of two students at St Madeleine's Primary School I have serious concerns
      about the safety implications for students and the community if the parking
      facilities on site are dramatically reduced to accommodate a cemetery.  \r\n\r\nHaving
      been briefed on the proposal just last week by both the parish priest and a
      member of the parish finance committee, it is my understanding that the cemetery
      is not being proposed because there is a demand for one in the area, but rather
      to bank roll the cost of building a new church on the site. I can't in good
      conscience support an application that doesn't meet the needs of the community
      but is solely a fundraising exercise. \r\n\r\nLastly I would like to say I am
      less than thrilled at the prospect of my children being exposed to several funerals
      each week. I'm disappointed the parish hasn't thought to factor in the emotional
      well being of the children in their community and I sincerely hope the proposal
      is not given the green light. \r\n\r\nAmanda Lynch"

        Thank you for your email, the below is provided for your info:
        A Conciliation Conference was arranged for the above matter for 3 November
        2016. We sent a letter to residents on 19 October 2016 regarding the
        Conciliation Conference following the applicant confirming their
        availability for that date.
        The applicant has now requested that the Conciliation Conference meeting
        be postponed to explore opportunities which may result in a revised
        development, potentially without a cemetery.

      line with any type of normal town planning. Previously, this area has been seen
      a rural residential with most properties in the area sitting on 1 1/2 acres
      (both Bannockburn and Rosemount Farm). I find it amazing that the developer
      can propose block sizes as low as 187sqm and with maximum size sitting around
      600sqm (disgusting money grab if you ask me). As someone previously mentioned
      about Bannockburn Road (19 units on one block), all this is doing is devaluing
      the suburb as most of these mini blocks will be either owned by investors or
      housing commission (no owner occupiers anymore). Also, if you have look at the
      entire proposed development (31 Belivah Road) you will see that where those
      beautiful gums trees along Beaudesert Beenleigh road now stand, a future park
      is proposed.. I wonder if the developer will at least retain these magnificent
      trees?? I recently voted in the new councillor Laurie and am now wondering if
      she will actually stand up for rural residents in the area and block this development,
      or as a minimum demand that the minimum block size stay at 500sqm no less. Having
      said all that, consider.. on the corner of Bannockburn road and Beaudesert Beenleigh
      road there soon will be, Bannockburn village with Woolworths, a wonderful parking
      lot, shops and cafes, next to that those 19 units and then opposite.. Davidson
      at Belivah with its lower socioeconomic design.. My advise folks, sell up and
      move further out as logan city council and co. is about to impose Yarrabilba

    text: " I wish to state my disapproval of this application and request you decline
      the DA as it currently stands, for the following reasons. Glenorie is a unique
      suburb that has managed to capture a lovely semi-rural atmosphere that encapsulates
      the ideal for family living. It is a safe suburb and most of its community have
      moved to this area for that very reason and are passionate about the lifestyle
      that most dream of. This DA will undoubtedly bring a stop to this. Currently,
      the congestion experienced on Post Office Road and Old Northern Road is at maximum
      capacity. Both roads are one lane in and out. To approve this DA of 24 units
      would permanently increase the traffic and roadside parking issues. The current
      owners of the Glenorie Bakery and Shopping Centre are unable to fill stores
      already in the complex. It goes against common sense to approve a DA that would
      increase the number of shops and apartments only to have them sit empty awaiting
      tenants. The area has only just had the sewer connected and many are still experiencing
      issues with sewer. There are also serious issues with drainage on Old Northern
      Road and Post Office Road. We do not have the infrastructure in the form of
      public transport to accommodate current homeowners, let alone potentially 50
      more. The proposed building is not in keeping with the country atmosphere that
      Glenorie is known for. I worry about the safety of school children who catch
      buses just opposite the proposed DA site; not to mention the public school children
      already dicing with trucks on Old Northern Road and congested traffic in the
      mornings and afternoons on Post Office Road. I would hope that The Hills Council
      would value their semi-rural areas enough to think long and hard about this
      DA. I am not against development and progress in the right form. However, this
      is not the right form for our area."

      nuisance with noise levels ever increasing and dust pollution that starts most
      mornings around 5am, sometimes earlier. This noise from reverse beepers revving
      of large deisel engines and clanging of steel containers can be heard for approx
      1 km away, and is ever increasing. Is this the environment we want in the CBD,
      residential and tourism area of our heritage City.\r\nDespite complaints to
      Toll they have done nothing to adjust operating hours, noise levels and dust
      pollution. This shows lack of empathy  with local community concerns.\r\nRate
      payers, tourists,schools and hospitals in and around East Launceston should
      expect our city council support and intervention"

    text: "To Whom This May Concern \r\n\r\nI am writing in regards to the Development
      Application MCU16/0166 for 10 Lewis Place - Dual Occupancy.  We live in the
      block directly east of  10 Lewis Place on Plantation Rise Drive.  We are concerned
      about the height of the proposed duplex, especially the duplex designated Unit
      1 in the Proposal Plans.  We object to the height of the upper level and the
      deck of this unit, as this unit is on the slope well above us and will be looking
      directly over our back yard and into our alfresco area, resulting in no privacy
      and negatively impacting on the amenity of our block.  Unit 1 is positioned
      in such a way that it is very close to our property and this coupled together
      with the height of the duplex and the terraced block prevents any landscaping
      solutions or other privacy measures to be effective. \r\nWe note that while
      privacy and overlooking in relation to the blocks north and south of the subject
      lot are discussed in the proposal description (Pg 3 Covering Letter), privacy
      and overlooking in relation to the blocks on Plantation Rise Drive to the east
      of the subject block have not been discussed, and perhaps have not been assessed.
      Of particular concern is the orientation of four large glass sliding doors and
      four alfresco  areas directly to the east, which, coupled with the steep slope,
      will leave us with little privacy. We are also worried about the potential for
      noise issues from these four alfresco areas so close to our house.  We are concerned
      the privacy and overlooking and other amenity issues in relation to more than
      half the properties that border onto the subject block haven’t been included
      in this application for Council to consider when assessing to increase occupancy
      and development intensity.\r\nIt also appears from the elevation drawings that
      that we will no longer have any views to the west, which is one of the main
      reasons we bought our block of land and built on it.  While we expected we might
      lose some views when a house was built on 10 Lewis Place, however, the proposed
      two separate duplexes will leave us with little to no views or privacy. \r\n\r\nWe
      request that Council rejects this application for Dual Occupancy on the basis
      that privacy and overlooking and other amenity issues in relation to more than
      half the properties that border onto the subject block haven’t been assessed
      or considered during the proposal design. We submit that the steepness of the
      block would largely mean any duel occupancy proposal would unreasonably  and
      unavoidably impact on neighbours, and that the proposed density would leave
      few options for remediation of these impacts. \r\nKind Regards\r\nLinda Addona
      and David Stevenson\r\n"

    text: "Dan Mills, \r\nI agree with you. There is a block carved off from the back
      of a house at 50 Dunmore Street. It's tiny and has been for sale since about
      Christmas time. No wonder. You would be lucky to get a decent sized garage on
      it. The house at the front, in addition is being modernised with a car port
      that looks like it was designed by the Jensens. The house is a brick veneer
      that has been bag washed . The carport is totally inappropriate. I asked the
      builder why he didn't put a gable type structure there which would suit the
      age and design of the house and his clever answer was \"the material doesn't
      support being shaped like that. WHAT?  Can't a different, suitable material
      be sourced. I understand the property belongs to a planning officer. Does that
      have something to do with the relaxed way things are done in our city?"

    text: "It's time that council reconsidered the layout of such a facility with
      the interests of all parties, including residents, in the area of the stables.\r\nThe
      racecourse is built on a large parcel of land in the midst of an established
      residential area. Whilst it may have been acceptable many decades ago for stables
      to be built fronting a residential street, today it isn't acceptable to most
      residents. Hygiene, security, noise, and residents' right to peaceful existence
      in their properties are critical factors. Further, workers' and visitors' car
      parking becomes not only an inconvenience to residents, but a road safety issue
      on narrow streets that have to accommodate large 4WD vehicles and multi-horse
      carriers. And then there are the added disruptions of a large event at least
      one day a week.\r\nThe racecourse is built on sufficient land that will enable
      the animal facilities to be located well within the racecourse property, away
      from residences. Further, within a secure environment, property, human and animal
      welfare is better manageable. Further, with large number of vehicles attracted
      to the complex each day, the racecourse should provide for adequate facilities
      for workers, stakeholders and visitors alike.\r\nIn principle, make the facility
      self-contained in function and 'nuisance factor'.\r\n"

        Dear lex.
        Further advice below  from officers re your concern.

        Yes the resident is correct. The poles are close to the back of the Kerb.
        The previous advice is relevant in that RCC conditioned more extensive works however the developer took Council to Court to reduce the requirements.
        Essentially the outcome was determined by Court and Council is bound by that judgement.
        However, once the works are finished Council will review the works and see what mitigation/warning signage etc may be needed and will try and negotiate minor improvements with the developer and his consultant

      text: "Dear Lex,\nThank you for your questions. The detailed response just in
        from RCC officers.\n\nThe Cross Lane and Little Shore Street works including
        a yellow line marking were allowed by Planning and Environment Court (Appeal
        No. 3988 of 2015).  Although Council initially asked for a wider pavement
        and verge at Cross Lane, the Court's final decision was to allow a 5.5m width
        and narrower verge on the development side. The original width of old pavement
        at Cross Lane was about 3.6m, while the new pavement will be at least 5m wide
        plus the width of kerb on each side, making a minimum 5.5m wide useable road.
        \nIn traffic engineering terms the Court was satisfied with experts that a
        5.5m wide road is sufficient for Cross Lane inclusive of additional traffic
        generated by the development.\nThe developer is committed to fully reinstate
        the affected parkland and road verges including re-turfing and landscaping
        as necessary."

      Every single new development has a reduction in parking spaces and loading bays.
      No thought seems to be given to where people will park. The fact that we have
      good public transport networks in Brunswick does not mean that people don''t
      have cars. The area between Sydney Rd and Breese St, near Anstey Station has
      become so high-rise, high-density it has completely changed the character of

    text: I think that we are coming perilously close to destroying the essential
      character of many inner city suburbs. I am all for medium density housing but
      it needs to be contained to appropriate areas such as old factory/warehouse
      sites. Some of the recent developments are like suburbs within suburbs. Aren't
      these developments enough for this area? Do we need to destroy the streets of
      low rise, single family dwellings that are a major contributor to the reason
      that many people want to live in the inner city? Public transport is already
      at breaking point so people will resort to cars and repeatedly developers request
      a reduction in parking spaces. There is already talk of an oversupply of apartments.
      Moreland should take the lead and reject some of the applications based on what
      the area can support and maintaining the character of the area.

      very sad to see this building demolished and see it replaced with an ugly apartment
      building. (which is a grose overdevelopment of the site!!).   \r\nI thought
      you may be interested to know that Mooroolbark residents have fought this development
      on two occasions.  The first time I was not involved, but I believe local residents
      fought this development which resulted in a VCAT hearing.  Sadly, VCAT supported
      YRC and the developer, resulting in the planning application being upheld.  My
      understanding is that this developer went into liquidation (or something similar),
      the development did not go ahead and the site was passed onto another company.\r\nI,
      along with other residents, objected to the current application (YR-2016/513)
      last year.  Once again YRC decided to grant a permit.\r\nThis of course is very
      disappointing.  It is also disappointing that there has not been a  response
      from Cr Tim Heenan to your comment.   \r\nIt is great to hear from others who
      feel that Mooroolbark is worth saving from developers!!\r\n"

    text: "Over the past few years we have seen a significant increase in the number
      of child care services established in the Lake Macquarie area. The proposed
      developments for more child care centres in the Cardiff area raises serious
      concerns about the impact it will have on surrounding child care services including
      long day care, family day care and preschools, particularly if there is inadequate
      demand for further facilities in this location. Several of the newer child care
      services in Cardiff and surrounding areas still have vacancies, therefore, the
      development of further child care centres will inevitably cause Cardiff to reach
      its saturation point and potentially put existing organisations out of business.
      This includes the potential demise of community child care, loss of jobs and
      reduced quality of care and education for children. In previous years we experienced
      the devastating effects of for-profit providers dominating the market. More
      recently we have been informed of child care centres in NSW and ACT being forced
      to close because the demographics of the towns are unable to support the many
      centres in the area.\r\nWith this in mind, I am concerned that social and economic
      impacts have not been adequately assessed for the development of more child
      care centres in Cardiff. If the potential providers cannot demonstrate that
      there is adequate demand for more facilities in these locations, we could end
      up with an oversupply of purpose built developments that result in the closure
      of existing facilities which are difficult to re-purpose. \r\nThere are well-established
      child care services in the area and an influx of for-profit centres will impact
      on their business and thin quality as the staff to child ratios in for-profit
      centres usually only meets minimum requirements. Support of community-based
      child care centres is encouraged because all surplus funds are invested back
      into the service to directly benefit the children resulting in high quality
      care and education. \r\n"

    text: "I object to the fact that the neighbouring properties are not properly
      displayed on any plans, elevations or rendered drawings. The neighbours are
      conveniently covered by a tree in the rendered drawing. There is no reference
      to the heights of existing neighbouring buildings and comparison with the proposed
      development. The shadow diagrams are not enough to show this relationship and
      how it affects the street scape. The elevations do not show any neighbouring
      buildings as they should.\r\nThe overall design of the buildings is unsympathetic
      with the existing street-scape, and although there is no requirement by council
      to 'copy' period style buildings, this design does not demonstrate any relationship
      with its surrounds, especially neighbouring houses. As neighbouring buildings
      are not shown on the drawings, any evidence that there is a response to the
      street scape is not possible to determine. Contemporary design should indeed
      be encouraged, yet this proposal demonstrates another run of the mill attempt
      to be modern and creates a non-eventful outcome in any taste that as no reference
      to its surrounds. The colour pallet has no reference to and does not respond
      to the existing street scape. Modern design can happily stand on its own merit
      and blend in sympathetically with its surrounds, yet this does not.\r\nThere
      are no provisions for any parking, and although council would like to encourage
      a no-car future, it is highly unlikely and creates high and unrealistic demand
      on already stretches street parking.\r\n\r\n"

    text: 6 stories is too high! Especially when it's such a small block. There is
      something similar that's been built almost directly over the road from this
      and it is ridiculous. The  streetscape is being destroyed in this part of Lygon
      Street, it's going to turn into a permanently shadowed wind tunnel at this rate.
      This is not in keeping with the nature of the street, or at least what it was
      until it started down this current path. And is there even a demand for these
      dog boxes that are getting built? Is anyone seriously crying out for poorly
      built, tiny roomed apartments looking directly onto a busy street? This is over
      development plain and simple and it should not be allowed.

      These developments force the neighbors out of the area, as they did not choose

      a snowball destructing effect as more residents sell up and move out., resulting

      the large family homes don't come up on the market often. But, as every large
      block comes on the market now, as was the case with 16 Boston Road, they are
      quickly snapped up by the developers as they know we are part of the 15 % developers

      and kirk rd corner  these are similar to chambers flat rd style  this type of
      structure will devalue our land greatly  and spoil our quality of life looking
      on to these structures  often these businesses go broke leaving an uncared look
      of broken plastic tunnels and a great mess  in this instance there are no other
      structures for about 4 kms and none that we look at   why should we suffer for
      an outsider who has recently bought the property for his own gain?   recently
      the tunnels along chambers flat rd have greatly extended in full view of everyone
      without any landscaping etc in front   this is also in flood area which has
      been filled and will flood over the neighbouring turf farm causing financial
      hardship.

        I will ensure they are passed to the planning officers for inclusion as part
        of the assessment process. \n\nI am not sure where this application is sitting
        at the present. I have asked officers for a briefing and I will be providing
        input and feedback as a matter of course.\n\nIn saying this, the zoning of
        the land in Chambers Flat is predominantly rural and farming and the existing
        zoning  may permit this use. If this is the case then Council will be hard
        pressed to reject the use on any legal or planning grounds. If that is the
        case then I will be pushing very hard to have the most stringent conditions
        allowed imposed on the application. \n\nOn the other end of the scale, perhaps
        the zoning may also prohibit the intensification of the rural land use. If
        this is the case the Council will no doubt have grounds to reject the application.\n\nI
        have asked officers to provide a briefing ASAP.\n\nThere is still some way
        to go yet and I thank you for giving your feedback.\n\nKindest Regards\nPhil"

    text: "Morning Michael, \r\n\r\nNot a good start for a new council, yes we will
      be taken action against the Bundaberg City Council and have contacted the Planning
      and Environment Court. We are disappointed in and have a vote of no confidence
      in the planning department given the circumstances in which this application
      was approved, furthermore as a public servant we have raised the question of
      access to which you have not responded. \r\n\r\nYou have stated that once approved,
      an application cannot be cancelled but you can have the application amended
      (ref to letter addressed to C L Field on the 13 April 2016)13 days after approval
      and replaced the previous decision dated the 1st April. The council can amended
      the decision and correct the errors so that it does comply with P07 section
      A to F and table 9.4.4.3.3 which states that rear access strips will not exceed
      60 meters in length and that minimum access to  cul-de-sac head must be be 15
      meters. It is up to the developer to comply with planning codes it should be
      your job to see that they do. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso you stated that, Once issued
      by a relevant entity and after the expiry of any appeal periods. an applicant
      is fully entitled to act on a decision notice, what appeal period?, we were
      not offered a right of appeal, but did make our concerns know to council and
      the planning department early in 2015, long before the application was approved.
      \r\n\r\nRegards Peter & Catherine Boes\r\n\r\nPS Just noticed that work has

    text: "Up Date on the application for the development of a subdivision at the
      end of Pleasant Drive Sharon. The application was approved while in caretaker
      mode on the 1st April. This development was approved by Mr. Michael Ellery (Group
      Manager Development) and did not go the council.  \r\nA meeting was arranged
      to meet with Mr.  Ellery at the location on the 7th July to explain how this
      development would work and address our concerns about further subdivision of
      \  this  very steep water catchment area,( size 99,473m2),  in the 2013 flood
      this land was all but meters under water.   Mr Ellery response to our concerns
      about all aspects of the development was at the best disappointing. In relation
      to the conditions of which the application was approved Mr Ellery seemed vague
      to the point of not realizing that he in fact was the one who approved it.  When
      questioned about the possibility of future flooding in that area, his response
      was ‘well they will know what to expect’. Moreover when questioned about evacuation
      planning, his response was there will be plenty of warnings for people to get
      out in time, (Tell that to the residents of North Bundaberg who had little time
      to get out in the 2013 floods)\r\n Asked if this application had gone to council
      would it have been approved, Mr. Ellery’s response was ‘probably’ this begs
      the question why do we need councilors at all.   Mr. Ellery stated that if the
      application, (which was prepared by paid professionals that pride themselves
      in ‘unlikely to be refused’) ticked all the boxes there should be no objections.
      \ \r\nNote;  later the same day as our meeting with  Mr Ellery, Mr Adam Johnston(
      Senior Development Engineer), sent  an approval  for operational works (subject
      to conditions) to be carried out, coincidence or is the application being rushed
      through.   This application for the subdivision of land at the end of Pleasant
      Drive Sharon should be placed on hold until it meets the requirements set out
      in reconfiguring of a  Lot Code and access because as it stands the application
      does not meet the requirements. The requirements as stated by Mr Ellery are
      outlined below\r\nIn relation to your questions about road frontage, I note
      that the Reconfiguring of a Lot Code provides for reduced frontages for hatchet
      (rear access) lots.  The following is an extract from the current code that
      outlines the requirements:\r\n \r\nRear (hatchet) lots\r\nPO7\r\nDevelopment
      provides for rear lots to be created only where:-\r\n(a)   the lots are not
      likely to prejudice the subsequent development of adjoining land;\r\n(b)   it
      is not desirable nor practicable for the site to be reconfigured so that all
      lots have full frontage to a road;\r\n(c)    the siting of buildings on the
      rear lot is not likely to be detrimental to the use and amenity of the surrounding
      area;\r\n(d)   uses on surrounding land will not have a detrimental effect on
      the use and amenity of the rear lot;\r\n(e)   the safety and efficiency of the
      road from which access is gained is not adversely affected; and\r\n(f)    vehicular
      access to rear lots does not have a detrimental impact on lots adjoining the
      access strip due to excessive noise, light, dust, stormwater runoff and the
      like.\r\nAO7\r\nRear lots are designed such that:-\r\n(a)   the minimum area
      of the lot, exclusive of any access strip, complies with the minimum lot size
      specified in Table 9.4.4.3.2 (Minimum lot size and dimensions);\r\n(b)   the
      gradient of the access strip does not exceed 10%;\r\n(c)    no more than four
      lots directly adjoin the rear lot, excluding lots that adjoin at one point;\r\n(d)
      \  no more than three lots gain access from the same access handle;\r\n(e)   no
      more than 10% of lots within a subdivision are accessed from an access handle;\r\n(f)
      \   where two rear lots adjoin each other, a single common driveway and reciprocal
      access easements are provided;\r\n(g)   no more than two rear lots and/or rear
      lot access strips directly adjoin each other (excluding lots that directly adjoin
      each other at a single point e.g. a corner);\r\n(h)   rear lot access strips
      are located on only one side of a full frontage lot; and\r\n(i)     rear lot
      access strips and driveways comply with the requirements of Table 9.4.4.3.3
      (Access strip requirements for rear lots) and the standards specified in the
      Planning scheme policy for development works.\r\n \r\n \r\nTable 9.4.4.3.3 states:\r\n
      \r\nAccess strip requirements for rear lots\r\n \r\nColumn 1 Zone\r\nColumn
      2 Minimum width of single access strip (metres)\r\nColumn 3 Minimum width of
      combined access strips with reciprocal easement (metres)\r\nColumn 4 Minimum
      driveway width\r\n(metres)\r\nColumn 5 Maximum driveway length (metres)\r\nResidential
      zones\r\n5\r\n6 (2x3)\r\n3.5\r\n40\r\nRural residential zone\r\n6\r\n6 (2x3)\r\n3.5\r\n60\r\nRural
      zone\r\n10\r\n10 (2x5)\r\n4\r\n100\r\n \r\n  \r\n"

    text: Thanks, but there is nothing more to say, it's done, however I will say
      on record that we are very disappointed in the way this was passed while council
      was in caretaker mode and the underhanded methods used to by The developer to
      obtain this result. Moreover in the  Bundaberg City Council complete disregard
      for better management of flood areas. But then greedy developers will always
      win when local councils fail to do there job to protect these water catchment

        Hi Derek,
        Unfortunately the Planning application for the Reconfiguration of Lots at 66 Pleasant Dr/4 Workman's Rd Sharon, was approved by delegation while BRC was in caretaker mode during the election period. The conditioned approval was granted on the 1/4/16 , so the Council that I am part of has had no say or involvement with the approval of this application. Currently before Council is the Operational works application which is just for  the scope of work that is to be carried out as per the conditions of the development approval.
        If this application would have come before me, I would have also questioned the flooding issues and the concerns of the residents that submitted public submissions against the development, but as approval has been granted, there is nothing Council can do except ensure that the conditions of the development are met.
        Should you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please give me a call or email.
        Regards
        Jason.

    text: 'i''ve recently moved to Sharon. it would amaze me if the local planning
      authorities don''t already have regulations against any new building in areas
      known for flooding risks, as climatologists warn us that these flooding events
      will increase in frequency and severity. if this development is approved, it
      would be negligent to the community (the cost of unnecessary emergency services)
      and all our insurance premiums (bigger payouts for flood damaged properties
      will raise all premiums), and would be especially damaging to people who might
      buy the new properties without understanding the flood damage they will likely
      incur in the future. '

    text: The open green space at this site is well used by local residents, this
      is a high density area and more green space is needed rather than reducing green
      space, The development of this site will significantly increase the residentian
      population of the area and hence the need for more green space.

      to protect significant trees and this tree is listed on the City of Yarra Significant
      Tree Study. \r\n\r\nThis is the kind of decision that should have had community
      involvement. How horrible? Is it a case of someone with money, who wants to
      make more money by building tiny, boxy apartments,unscrupulously purchasing
      an adjacent property to desecrate the landscape and kill a wonderful living
      tree? What is going on?\r\n\r\nWhy? Why does the Council go along with such
      immorality? Why do the Greens call themselves Greens and not make a big fuss?
      Was it for an extra apartment? It’s not just a significant tree - it’s a tree
      that's grown and given joy for over fifty years. It’s living. It's added to
      our world without taking anything away. It’s ethically and morally wrong to
      destroy it. \r\n"

      garage and to save the occupants continually moving cars out they will park
      on the street. The frontage of the houses will be forward on the block closer
      to the street which is not in the same style as all other surrounding houses

      it as a thoroughfare to get to either Cross or South Roads which will also create
      the potential for a serious crash in a residential street.  I am all for progress
      but not at the expanse of the local community feeling and over crowding of residential
      streets just for the council to make more income from rates etc. '

        Development \nApplication No: 100/825/2016 proposing three single storey row
        dwellings \nat 58 Wheaton Street, South Plympton. \n\nPersonally I believe
        that the Development Plan guidelines were loosened up \nfar too much (over
        ten years before I became Mayor in 2014). Dense housing \ninfill has created
        all sorts of problems. For these reasons the current \nCouncil under my leadership
        has written to the Planning Minister to change \nthe guidelines; this is a
        lengthy process however and all current \napplications must of course be assessed
        under the current Development Plan \nguidelines.\n\nI am advised by staff
        that this application is exempt from public \nconsultation and accordingly,
        the Development Act and associated \nRegulations do not allow adjacent property
        owners to be formally notified \nof the proposed development or formally object
        to the application. \n\nHowever, I am pleased to tell you that Council's Planning
        Staff have \nadvised the applicant that they won't support the proposal in
        its current \nform because it fails to meet a number of criteria in the Development
        \nPlan. \n\nTo be fair, the developer will be given a chance to address the
        problems \nwith a variation to the application. One possible outcome is a
        reduction \nin the number of dwellings from 3 to 2. \n\nI encourage you to
        contact Justin Clisby, the planning officer assessing \nthe application on
        8375 6600 to ascertain a status update in a couple of \nweeks. By that time
        he might be in a position to let you know how the \napplicants responded to

    text: "Re:  Environmental Impact of Blaxland McDonalds Carpark Entry/Exit & Layton
      Ave\r\n\r\nI regret that I was not able to contact Council earlier to comment
      on the Development Proposal relating to McDonalds at Blaxland. Unfortunately
      I was in hospital and this is really the first opportunity I have had to make
      my position known. \r\nBasically, I share the same view of other members of
      my family at No.s 23, 25 and 27 Layton Ave Blaxland. Our concerns relate primarily
      to safety issues but also to environmental factors as well. \r\nWhilst living
      just down the road from the existing McDonalds over the past 9 months, since
      moving here last September, we have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. Traffic congestion/ blockage
      of Layton Ave to through traffic at the entrance/exit to McDonalds  caused by
      the poor set out of Layton Ave from the Gt Western Hwy to the McDonalds entrance.
      It is a one-lane road that is blocked by;\r\n                                           a)
      Patrons queuing to enter McDonalds that form a line of stopped traffic back
      to the Gt Western Hwy due to lack of parking in McDonalds and the drive through
      service driveway being backed right up to the entrance not allowing patrons
      entry.\r\n                                            b) The fact that patrons
      park on the side of Layton Ave between the Gt Western Hwy and the McDonalds
      entrance not allowing through traffic to pass to the left side of the line of
      cars queued to enter McDonalds.\r\nThis section of Layton Ave from the Gt Western
      Hwy to the McDonalds entrance should be dual lanes with a right turn only lane
      for the entrance into McDonalds. There should be no parking along this section
      of road so that through traffic can pass by the patrons lined up waiting to
      enter the  McDonalds car park.\r\n\r\n2.  Many vehicles turning into our driveways
      to do a U-turn, sometimes proving to be a hazardous action with obstruction
      to oncoming traffic and near accident misses\r\n\r\n3.  A significant amount
      of litter, as customers of McDonalds walk past and dispose of their rubbish,
      McDonalds packaging etc by throwing it onto our front lawn/s and leaving it
      at the bus stop seat/bench at the front of 27 Layton Ave.\r\n\r\n4. Due to the
      location of the existing entry/exit to McDonalds, near or on the bend about
      40 metres from the traffic lights at the intersection of the Great Western Hwy
      and Layton Ave, there is a real and great risk of accidents involving both cars
      and pedestrians. This is particularly problematic during the afternoons at the
      end of the school day, evenings as commuters travel home from work and, especially
      on weekends any time of the day or evening. We have witnessed and experienced
      traffic jams all the way down Layton Ave from the McDonalds car park entry/exit,
      sometimes to the Stop Sign just before the underpass. \r\n\r\nIt is my/our view
      that the location of this entrance/exit should be given serious consideration
      as part of any Development Proposal/Application. Given that there is a large
      parcel of vacant land in front of McDonalds on the Great Western Highway, perhaps
      if this land was made available to McDonalds to purchase from the RTA (presuming
      such land is owned by the RTA) and McDonalds was willing to purchase this land,
      then that would be a much more suitable location for a car park entry/exit.
      It would be far safer to access and less intrusive on nearby residents. \r\n
      \r\nPlease consider these points in your appraisal of McDonalds Development
      Proposal and as part of your overall town planning to ensure improved safety
      and better traffic flow generally, thank you.\r\n\r\nKind regards                                                                                                                                                      \r\nAnnette
      Legge and family                                                                                                                                                                      \r\n"

      \ continued?When the required conditions for this   venture can not be met.\r\nThe
      one point five meters between our boundaries , is impossible on the Northern
      side . There is only about thirty centre  meters between our boundary and the
      proposed venues surgery and recovery rooms, which also have leaky wooden windows.A
      two meter Buffer Zone around the proposed parking area would leave little or
      no room for the recommended five car parks plus one Van. There is no room to
      construct a five meter Buffer along the Northern boundary. This would not comply
      with streetscape  requirements. \r\nNot only would our way of life,be greatly
      affected,by noise from barking dogs and similar activities and noises. But our
      lives would be compromised. There is solid proof that diseases are transmitted
      from animals and bird,to humans.These serious ailments can kill humans especially
      the elderly and young.\r\nApproval of this application would make a absolute
      mockery of Council requirements.  Any further developments  could also expect
      similar exemptions with their applications.\r\nWe are afraid that the required
      conditions will be wavered or watered down ,leaving us with little or no protection.
      If this application is approved ,it would give him a substantial increase in
      value to his property.This would be at the expense of the people  who reside
      in the close vicinity. concerned residents Brian and Pixie Roediger"

    text: "An interesting side note to this application .... 12 months ago, residents
      in Queens Park Precinct were requested to apply for parking permits should they
      need to park on the street in front of their own homes ... Of those that applied,
      many were refused for trivial reasons (mostly because these homes have rear
      access via Lawson, Ora and Tana Lanes). These houses are mostly Old Workers
      Colonial Cottages on blocks ranging in sizes of 500 - 600 metres, none of which
      were designed for the multiple vehicles which today's lifestyle demands of many
      families. \r\n\r\nWell, this week, Council has had the best of both worlds!
      All residents with vehicles parked in Eleanor Street received parking fines!\r\n\r\nWell
      done TRC!\r\n\r\nMy question is: how do you propose to accomodate parking for
      a facility such as that which is proposed at 37 Godsall Street? Will each client
      and staff member be expected to apply for a parking permit? Will these parking
      permits be denied based on the fact that the property concerned is technically
      two-street frontage (regardless of the land area being too small to accomodate
      adequate off street parking)? \r\n\r\nAnd whilst I'm playing Devil's Advocate,
      many (dare I say, most!) land developments in Toowoomba (eg Healy Street, Long
      Street near St Vincent DePaul, south Street near Fourth Avenue) are now 200
      square metres at the most, is Council planning to employ dozens more parking
      inspectors to fine all of these residents who can't fit vehicles on their land
      and can only park on the street? Oh that's right, they have the opportunity
      to apply for parking permits! Which I'm sure attract a submission fee, and of
      course, the permit will be rejected (the processing of which increases council
      expenses, which then of course increases the fee for future submissions) am
      I seeing a vicious cycle here?"

      or at weekends ,at the surgery. This is unrealistic as sick and  animals recovering
      from surgery would not be sent home. This is common practice by all vets. These

    text: "It seems that 'Beriston' regularly makes the news for all the wrong reasons!
      \r\n\r\n37 Godsall Street has been put before council by a previous owner requesting
      significant alteration to the integrity of the original architecture and has
      been rejected! ... Rightly so! But the legacy of this rejection is 'Beriston'
      has lost her identity, and forever been etched upon the reminiscences of Toowoomba
      Residents as 'Pig House' ... Who can forget the giant pig nose and ears attached
      to the roof, the graffiti which could still be seen until recently... Or the
      upended cars buried in the backyard! How is this proposal different?? \r\n\r\nThis
      is a home that attracts attention ... It automatically leads your eye as you
      drive along Hume Street ... I'm certain that the current owners were well aware
      of this when they paid a premium $675,000 at auction on May 2, last year; and
      I suspect this business venture was very prominent in their thinking at the
      time, and this application most certainly explains some of the renovations already
      undertaken!  Well why wouldn't they .... It's a very rare occurrence that TRC
      rejects ANY development application!\r\n\r\nJust say 'NO!' TRC! ... Just say
      'NO!' .... No, no, no to CMU, No to signage, No to off-street parking, no, no,
      no, no, NO!\r\nI look at this home everyday and know that I'm 300 metres from
      my house .... It talks to me and says 'welcome home your day is done'. This
      is a spectacular home in an absolute prime location ... Let's keep it that way!"

    text: Laurie, I raise concerns with regard to the increased traffic. What will
      the council do to improve traffic control at the intersection of Bannockburn
      and Beenleigh-Beaudesert Road, it would be a shame for the development to take
      place and for the council to lag in such upgrades posing risk to the public
      on an already busy intersection. Traffic signals and lighting is lacking. I
      would also like the council to consider if this development is in keeping with
      the area. I am all for growth and development, but having lived in the area
      for 20 years I don't think that such a high density development is in keeping
      with the area. A response to the above concerns would be greatly appreciated.

    text: Windaroo and Bannockburn, especially in the area near this proposed development
      appear to have a high level of owner occupier houses.  With the exception of
      a small "higher end" unit complex next the the Windaroo Golf Club there are
      no other unit complexes in these suburbs.  Building units in this area will
      devalue house prices and drive out owner occupiers.  I doubt that 96 units would
      sell at this location which would lead to a high percentage turning into housing
      commission, further devaluing house prices and potentially leading to an increase
      in crime.  I have lived in this area for the past 15 years and don't want to
      see it turn into an urban slum.

      the original moral intent under the original purpose to which this land was
      given to the church, which was to only use that piece of land for the purposes
      and practice of the Baptist religion for the local community of North and West
      Melbourne?\r\n\r\nA $50 million dollar 74 residential apartment with convenience
      shop development has absolutely nothing to do with the advancement of the Baptist
      religion in North and West Melbourne other than greed, so yes we in the local
      community call upon the Eighth Day Baptist church to sell that piece of land
      to Melbourne council for a park and go build your hi-rise apartments next door
      in Docklands where new hi-rise apartments are welcomed."

    text: "I am a retired CPA, a 30 year Balgowlah Heights resident approx 3 kms west
      of Manly CBD within the boundaries of the former Manly LGA, and immediate past
      Chair of Balgowlah Heights Precinct.\r\n\r\nWhere I live:\r\n1. I am that much
      less impacted by any negative and adverse flow-on features than those residing
      closer to the impact zone of the proposed development\r\n2. as a consequence
      I have a number of alternatives available to me which may not be as easily available
      to those closer to the impact zone and who would be in a better position to
      comment which I support because if I were in their position I would like to
      feel that I would have someone further away supporting me – the anti NIMBY approach;\r\n3.
      there is, however, one exception - where I am at one with all residents and
      ratepayers – from the deliberate scant publicly released information, the questionable
      viability and consequent negative effect on Council resources by the operation
      of Oval Car Park, and associated “asset recycling” sleight of hand of the Whistler
      Street site has an erosive effect on the efficient use of our commonly owned
      public assets\r\n4. it is a clear demonstration of financial incompetence and
      its negative flow-on effect on the general finances and public asset base of
      the Council and/or ability of Council to maintain levels of service.\r\n\r\nMy
      submission is for the JRPP to disapprove DA116/2016, JRPP reference 2016SYE058
      DA) on the following grounds:\r\n1. distorted “community consultation” process
      in that concerns of Precincts have been ignored, surveys have been selectively
      designed and based on incomplete information;\r\n2. inadequate and evasive responses
      to information requests, taken to the height of an art form particularly financial,
      in that requests for additional information including GIPA requests and appeals
      to tribunals were assessed on the basis of the “impartiality” of the author
      or requester;\r\n3. systemic aversion and lack of transparency to financial
      accountability in that I openly defy and challenge anyone to extract the financial
      viability of the MOCP from the CSP, its risks and underlying assumption which
      can be tested.\r\n4. failure to follow Local Government guidelines in that Council
      meetings were held in contravention of guidelines\r\n5. the selective compilation
      of the redacted report to 12/4/2016 (Black Tuesday) Manly Council meeting in
      that the background information provided, though brief is distorted, incomplete
      and biased.\r\n\r\nTo give an example - the released KPMG financial justification
      is conditional on the combination of assumptions that:\r\n1. there will be wholesale
      move of all current users of Whistler Street and those displaced by road restrictions
      to MOCP, and\r\n2. 16% (ie 21,000 of 425,000 parkers pa) of those who previously
      parked for free will now have to pay between them a 14% increase in the average
      fee per stay (from $12.28 to $14.00) which translates to an additional $423K
      pa or 31% increase on current Whistler Street revenue (from $1.383M to $1.806M)\r\n3.
      both from day 1 of the commencement of OCP operation\r\nThe conclusion of this
      vital and pivotal piece of information? - an optimistic, unrealistic, set of
      assumptions so critical to success.\r\nBased on the above assumptions, with
      revenue of $1,810K pa, estimated expenses of $800K pa and replacement of Whistler
      St clear net income (and currently being spent on services) of $1,020K pa this
      proposal carries considerable risk and is marginal at the very best even by
      ignoring standard expectations of a modicum return on capital invested.\r\nBeing
      a community asset project is no excuse in not applying generally accepted project
      evaluation criteria – if anything, there should be even greater diligence.\r\nFurther,
      the funding of its construction by way of “asset recycling” is of no comfort
      at all as ANY shortfall of the completed OCP (vis a vis current Whistler $1.02M
      clear net profit) means either asset reduction, long term loans, or reduced
      services – all impacting adversely on all residents/ratepayers.\r\nThe high
      risk that this project will not break-even is the concern of this objection.\r\nResidents
      have formed the conclusion that there is insufficient vital information with
      which to make an informed decision are fighting with hands tied behind their
      backs – this is not by accident or ignorance – this is deliberate, conniving
      and it smells - it is neither a fair nor transparent contest as financial justification
      is are kept hidden.\r\nThe crux of my objection is: \r\nhow can any responsible
      public body conduct “community consultation” (seeking resident/ratepayer approval)
      for the MOCP without a comprehensive financial risk assessment and analysis
      being included so that residents and ratepayers can respond to the consultation
      in an informed, personal responsible manner – at the end of the day, will the
      proposed public investment coupled with the public “asset recycling” leave the
      community financially better or worse off before agreeing to its go ahead –
      it is the residents/ratepayers who are the mortgagors of this project and they
      should have an informed say.\r\nI urge the JRPP to reject this DA."

      community, do not want or need another carwash, we want to make the area safer

      a more vibrant, family friendly hub at this end of Scarborough Beach Rd. We
      value the opportunity to comment and we trust you will hear our concerns and

      text: "Hi Sally\n\nThank you for your email. There has been a very strong community
        response on planning alerts to this planning application, particularly in
        relation to traffic impacts, parking and proximity to the Mulberry Tree daycare
        centre and MHPS. I also take your point on the number of car washes in the
        vicinity. There has been a rush of car wash applications in the last year,
        many of which have not been supported by Council due to location and traffic
        impacts.\n\nI asked City of Vincent Development Services Director Gabriela
        Poezyn about the timeframe for this to come to Council. It has been delayed
        due to the lack of a management plan. It is now expected to go to the August
        Council meeting. This will mean the agenda is available on the City’s website
        by Thursday 11 August:\nhttp://www.vincent.wa.gov.au/Your_Council/Agenda_Minutes\n\nIt
        will be discussed (questions and answer format) at the Council Briefing on
        Tuesday 16 August (6p.m. start with public question time first up) and then
        determined at the Council meeting of Tuesday 23 August (also an opportunity
        to speak during public question time after the meeting opens at 6p.m.). \n\nPlease
        don’t hesitate to call me to discuss the agenda item once released. I am starting
        back at my “other job” on Thurs 11 and Fri 12 August so probably best to talk
        over the following weekend or Monday 15 or Tues 16 August. Prior to that time,
        I am happy to have a general discussion, but won’t have access to the details
        or Officer Recommendation until the agenda is released.\n\nI hope you've been
        having a great time on the school holidays and a nice break from work.\n\nBest
        regards,\nEmma\n\n\n\n\nEmma Cole\nCouncillor- North Ward\nCity of Vincent

      on the area, and ensure the safety of it's residents.\r\nAnother factor, is
      that there is already carwashes in very close proximity and therefore no need
      for another one in the area.  \r\nI hope you hear the concerns of the Mount

    text: this proposed development is too big for this site I'm thinking. The site
      is small and narrow but if this development goes ahead much of the open space
      of their garden will be lost (so the neighbourhood becomes more crowded, dense
      and loses valuable green space). Also-the current site has taken and eaten into
      the dunny lane at theback-this needs to be restored and make the lane back to
      its original size. This development as planned is TOO BIG, too high, too much.
      Please keep any buildings proposed to the current size of the exisiting buildings

        Thanks Jenny,

        Thanks for the heads up on this development. Unfortunately Councillors or Advisers, as they are now called will no longer have any say in planning decisions.

        Instead an IHAB or Independent Hearing & Assessment Panel will do the assessments and approval process. The IHAP can recommend changes that normally would have been suggested by Councillors. Residents can submit to the IHAP and you should follow it up with Council.

        I'm happy to help prepare a submission if you need it.

        Chris

      no-one seems to have the will to do anything to change our current and future
      gridlock. The State Government is the only authority able to change this dismal
      future. \r\nCurrently, State Planning Regulations only require one (1) parking
      space for each dwelling (even 2 bedroom dwellings). Any VCAT hearing confirms
      this and the Local Authorities have no say in it at all.\r\nDevelopers continue
      to push the fallacy that a person purchasing a property relatively near public
      transport hubs will not want or even need a motor vehicle, they'll be using
      the public transport. \r\nThe only way any change to that thinking will occur
      is when Kingston Council introduce street parking permits to ratepayers (a-la
      the beach permits) and make it clear to developers and potential buyers of their
      developments that these street permits will not be available for their multiple
      dwelling properties.\r\nParking by-laws are the ONE power the Local Authorities
      have in these areas and, it's a long bow but, the thinking behind this may 'possibly'
      work if the developers then have great difficulty selling their dog boxes.\r\nIan,

    text: "Following is the Objection speech I presented to the IHAP meeting of the
      25 May 2016 where this Development Proposal was presented. I conclude with added
      recommendations when this proposal is passed by Council:\r\n\r\n1. My name is
      Alan Bond and I have lived at (left blank for this), Stanwell Tops for over
      26 years. I sent information to IHAP yesterday with photos of the subject site
      including the link to a video documentary I have on Youtube regarding this subject
      and also referring to the Nomination for Heritage Listing of Henry Halloran
      Park that would give background information. I trust this has been passed onto
      you?\r\n\r\n2. Up until seeing these Council papers online last Monday, I had
      no idea that there was not a lease on this Right of Carriage Way.\r\n\r\n3.
      As a matter of fact I had requested of Council all documentation as I could
      not find the council’s resolution of 1999 online.  However, the resolution was
      not sent to me.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, at all times it was referred to as a “lease”
      from day one. The adjacent neighbour when he spoke to Buckley’s Concreting contractor
      and asked him why they were excavating the access way, he was told the owner
      of 8 Longview had a “lease” on it.\r\n\r\n5. In all correspondence there was
      indicated that there was a lease. It was never corrected by anyone.\r\n\r\n6.
      But this has been presented by Council in notification letters initially as
      a “driveway” but now is referred to as a “road” in the IHAP meeting papers.
      Regardless, it is actually a private driveway on community property for the
      applicant’s soul desire to reach a garage. A fact that can not be denied.\r\n\r\n7.
      It can not be forgotten that the access way driveway was being originally built
      under PC-2015/979 and started to be excavated nearly 1 month prior to this seperate
      DA proposal.\r\n\r\n8. This particular DA occurred only after a number of inquiries
      by residents to Council about it being built on community land. Prior to that
      there was no public notification by Council to residents that this was going
      to occur. As a matter of fact it would seriously appear that Council also had
      no knowledge that this was occurring.\r\n\r\n9. So therefore it is relevant
      that it be associated with that “secondary dwelling” DA as this is obviously
      being used to gain access to that dwelling despite the fact that secondary dwelling
      should legally be entered from the front of the property which it can on the
      eastern side with parking on the street.\r\n\r\n10. There is an area on the
      eastern side of the property which is just over 2.5 metres wide with a side
      gate and pathway that can be easily used to comply with reaching the dwelling
      at the rear of the property. This is a fact and can not be denied.\r\n\r\n11.
      However, the subject property has a colourbond fence right across the property
      which would appear to be illegal under the “Secondary Dwelling” Act allowing
      no front entry. Even the private certifier confirmed that fact to me personally.
      Therefore this is the only logical and reasonable excuse for this driveway/road
      to access the secondary dwelling. This is a fact and can not be denied.\r\n\r\n12.
      I have sent information to the IHAP Panel in regards to photos showing the dangerous
      driveway/road as there is no mention in the meeting papers that there is a power
      pole in the way of this driveway that literally curves around it. This is a
      fact and can not be denied.\r\n\r\n13. Safety aspects have seemingly been dismissed
      in the meeting papers. However, there is no mention of my subject in the meeting
      papers that the local children, which there are many, will be drawn to this
      road to skateboard, etc down. It is too much of a tempting target for children
      who could either hit the power pole or just blindly ride out onto the road and
      into on coming traffic.  To be clear, I had this in my submission and Council
      have completely ignored this concern. But children’s safety can not be dismissed.
      This is a fact and can not be denied.\r\n\r\n14. A native banksia tree was also
      cut back from over hanging the Council access way to allow work vehicles to
      get onto the access way. This has been dismissed in the meeting papers as “it
      would appear not to meet the definition of a prescribed tree”, yet it was a
      native banksia, overhanging from the adjacent neighbour’s property over Council
      land, in this case the Council do not seem to want to do anything about it.
      This is a fact and can not be denied.\r\n\r\n15. The reason for only six objections
      was the fact that Council did not inform the entire Stanwell Tops Community
      of this DA which was strongly urged by residents who put in submissions to the
      extent that ALL of Stanwell Tops should be informed as it was community property.
      Despite repeated requests and information from John Woods that it was noted,
      Council failed to notify the entire community. A failure of Duty of Care. So
      just another fact that can not be denied.\r\n\r\n16. It must be Noted that it
      is extremely rare that the Stanwell Tops suburb gets The Advertiser newspaper
      that features these Council proposal notices. Not all residents are on the internet
      either.\r\n\r\n17. The concerning factor regarding the storm water run off is
      not what the meetings papers says, but in actual fact the reverse.\r\n\r\n18.
      That is, water running from the remaining untouched adjacent access way, because
      of the slope of the land towards the driveway, would run down the side of it.
      So let’s be clear on that.\r\n\r\n19. This Right of Carriage Way came from a
      precedent for a Right of Carriageway at Kembla Grange, which in the end was
      not acted upon. \r\n\r\n20. So it is extremely misinforming to say why this
      Right of Way also would not set a precedent, especially astoundingly, the grant
      of transfer is under the Real Property Act 1900. 116 years old!\r\n\r\n21. Extremely
      out of date with this grant already being 18 years old and also never acted
      upon till now. Which if it had been not acted upon for at least another 2 years
      can be cancelled by the Registrar General. Some updating by Council to 2016
      certainly seems to be required. \r\n\r\n22. Regarding the Council bollard at
      the end of this driveway/road and a parking space for a vehicle, it must be
      asked why there is a crossover from the rear of the property that is actually
      on Henry Halloran Park itself. \r\n\r\n23. Hypothetically, a rational person
      could logically, reasonably believe, that the subdivided property in the rear
      section could also house a “granny flat” in the extremely large shed that is
      described as a double garage thus giving you 3 “cluster” dwellings on 1 property
      in a proven bushfire zone. But that’s hypothetical, of course.\r\n\r\n24. However
      the most logical simple solution is this.\r\n\r\n25. I would recommend that
      the applicant approach Council and seek permission to use the main gated entry
      to the Park to enable to reach his garage which seems to be the sole object
      for this DA.\r\n\r\n26. I would see no problem with this. It would be a win,
      win solution all around and be advantage to enhance the nomination of Henry
      Halloran Park for Heritage Listing for all Australians. \r\n\r\n27. This Right
      of Carriage Way would no longer be required. Has the applicant approached Council
      for this?\r\n\r\n28. Finally, this “driveway/road” is not in the Public Interest,
      but as well, not in the Community Interest.\r\n\r\n29. Thank you - \r\n\r\nPresented
      by Alan Bond\r\n\r\nM recommendations would be:\r\n\r\n1. \"No Standing\" signs
      along the driveway.\r\n\r\n2. Removal of what appears to be a parking space
      at the end so the driveway finishes at the gates.\r\n\r\n3. Calming devices
      on the driveway itself. This would help in preventing children from using the
      path for skateboarding, etc activities that could lead to injuries."

      the impact that their decision making has on us.  We all chose to live in the
      Cotswold Hills area because of the lifestyle that it provided.  This lifestyle
      is now slowly but surely being taken away from us.  Morris Court is a cul-de-sac
      at the moment, and the residents of this street really want it to stay that

        were not addressed to me and my email was not in the communique so I was not
        informed of your questions until now when you included my email.\n\nTo try
        and answer your question, the average lot size is around 500 m2. The applicant
        had initially proposed far smaller lots but through the limited influence
        I have I have been attempting to force an outcome to achieve larger lot sizes
        across the board. The lots in this proposed development will consist of lots
        varying in size from 300 m2 through to 600m2 and will also include a large
        chunk of riverine parkland. \n\nI am not a fan of small lot development but
        the reality of this situation is that the State Government has zoned this
        area for urban development and as part of that legislation they have also
        made it law  that Council will approve residential development at a minimum
        density of 15 lots per hectare. If this application and others comply with
        the state legislation then Logan City Council or any Council for that matter
        cannot stop the development and has little power to reject it.\n\nSure, I
        can vote against it and Council can make a decision to reject it but the applicant
        will take it to court and the court will throw Councils decision out. Council
        cannot make decisions that go against state planning legislation as much as
        we say we should. Council has already been overturned on numerous rejections
        and the Labor State government is hell bent of creating as many high density
        blocks as possible so people can be more dependant on them. All part of their
        social engineering agenda sadly.\n\nAs the local Councillor I am doing the
        best I can to work the system to try and get the house blocks sizes increased
        as much as possible and get as much in the way of community facilities as
        possible.\n\nAlways happy to catch up and give you as much information as
        I can.\n\nKind Regards\nPhil"

        Hi Erica,



        Thanks for your interest in Apex Park. You'll be pleased to know that as part of the works required for the nearby development Apex Park will be upgraded.



        I've attached an image of the proposed layout for the park. As you can see there will be some swings, and other play equipment as well as a table and shelter.

        [cid:]



        If there is anything else I can help you with please let me know.


        Kind regards

      in line with Council's Development Control Plan but, given the current tight,
      merge-over-or-you-will-crash situation on that portion of street as it is, I
      do have real concerns.... NINE parking spaces for 19 Apartments (39 or so rooms!)
      seems totally inadequate. \r\n\r\nReading the application, the Developer does
      seem to 'assume' residents will utilise public transport. In an ideal world,
      yes, that would be the case. However, we need to be realistic. People who live
      in Studio apartments aren't always \"students\" without a car (as per their
      \ assumption) \r\n\r\nI'm all for creating more places for people to live, especially
      if it's close to Public Transport, but please, we can't \"assume\" that those
      residing in the development will not require a space to park a vehicle. Especially
      in that area, next to Woolworths and other retail outlets. \r\n\r\nThanks so

      4 units on a block is over the top. Every week-end there are 40-50 cars parked
      in Keith & Rae Ave''s making driving difficult to drive. We will get another
      80 or so cars when the RSL site is developed, maybe another 8 when the corner
      block on Rae & Kinross is developed, we get traffic going up and down our streets
      because cars are trying to miss parts of Edithvale road, and Lochiel has chicanes.
      I hope the council has some positive views of the local residents concerns before

    text: The builders associated with this application have commenced building even
      though there appears to be NO approved DA.  The building has been constructed
      contrary to submitted plans (wrong side of the block, different design than
      that submitted) and also that construction most days begins before 7.00AM (removing
      the concrete barge boards at this hour of the morning is just horrendous).  There
      are no winter solstice plans on website, no construction certificate appears
      to have been issued as well.  I raised these concerns with Parramatta City Council
      approximately 3 weeks ago and was advised that an inspector would monitor and
      visit the property.   There appear to be many breaches happening on the site.  There
      are also no boards displaying who the builder is, who to contact etc.  I also
      have observed poor OH&S on site (no hard hats, no forklift signage, rather loud
      music coming from site. There was also in incident (which I witnessed) of a
      person on site being verbally harassed and also being pushed about.  There is
      frequent course language also coming from site.  It appears that my concerns
      have fallen on deaf ears because these cowboys without a clue a still attempting
      to construct a rather dodgy looking building.

      campaign to get the Rowville rail up and running (I have been waiting since
      the mid 1970's) and yet they would consider approving this development with
      lower car parking availability.  At one stage my house had 7 cars - Parents,
      kids, partners....  If there isn't enough parking then lower the number of units.  OR
      - provide shared underground parking BEFORE the development is built!! .  If
      we are going to provide denser housing then the council needs to get smarter
      at how we go about it.   OK the plan - but make the developer come up with -
      and pay for  - a smarter idea on how to deal with the CURRENT parking requirements
      - AND - any road / traffic issue that arise from the development.  Even if it's
      after they are built and sold.

    text: "Hello,\r\n \r\nI write in connection with the above planning application.
      I have examined the plans and I know the site well as I have used the tennis
      court facilities frequently. I object to the development of such a large block
      of units in this location, with an inadequate number of car parking spaces.
      My objection is primarily because removing one of the local community's few
      remaining open-space, public-use sports facilities (ie, the tennis courts) will
      permanently be deleterious to the area.\r\n \r\nBondi Beach is already a heavily
      developed area, with numerous places of worship within a short walking distance
      from this location. Removing one of the rare open-air sports facilities that
      ALL residents can use, for the proposed use by only a small section of the community
      would be an example of extremely poor urban planning. There are numerous places
      of religious worship for the Jewish community less than a few minutes walk from
      here. Why does the area need another one in such close proximity to existing
      facilities? What benefit does it bring for the broader overall Bondi community?\r\n\r\nThis
      section of Wellington St is a residential street comprised mostly of semi-detached
      houses and this proposed development would negatively impact the character and
      amenity of the street. The scale of the development - two three-storey apartment
      blocks versus mostly one and two storey buildings on the street - will overwhelm
      the visual characteristics of the neighbourhood as well as hinder neighbours’
      sunlight, privacy and outlooks. These impacts will affect most nearby neighbours.
      \r\n\r\nTraffic congestion, and lack of car parking, is already a considerable
      issue in this section of Wellington street (it is frequently impossible to find
      an available street car park after 6pm). This development will create further
      extreme pressure on car parking given the low number of new car spaces proposed.
      It is simply not a sensible or appropriate location for such a development.\r\n\r\nThe
      negatives of this development resoundingly outweigh the positives. I hope Waverley
      Council considers the broad local community when assessing this development
      and does not approve it."

        DA. DLM Doutney has been involved in the ‘save the Alex’ campaign and she
        has a high interest in preserving this site. \nWe cannot call this for a briefing,
        as it is above 3 stories, however it will come to Council automatically to
        be discussed. We can keep you updated as we find out more.\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nGillian

    text: 'This proposed construction is too tall (over developed for the site) and
      out of proportion for the local area. It has no parking spaces allocated and
      no residents'' parking. This is unacceptable in the inner city/inner west. Yes,
      Redfern station is very close but we saw the issues involved when Channel 7
      moved in at Redfern- the employees all drove to work and the streets became
      congested - parking for locals became very difficult as cars parked illegally.
      The above comments from Gary Speechley cover very well the many issues involved.
      How is it that the developer hasn''t sorted out the building over the railway
      tunnel? I strongly object to this development.  '

      east. When the plan was passed by the DBU, the side set- back was described
      as \"nil to 2.5\"..It appears that we will have nil set back the entire fence-
      line! The \"concrete courtyard\" should not be an entertaining area, as it is
      just 1.5 from my 2 bedrooms. Council should not allow a fence to become a wall
      (2.53mm high). If access to this \"light well\" is from the bedroom only, of
      #9 Kent Street, and used passively, then there is no need for a high wall. The
      door from their dining room should be a window only. Then we can share the light
      and air between our 3 bedrooms.... and no need for acoustic or visual privacy!
      \r\nI see that the rear yard is to be raised over a water tank and a deck (with
      screen) elevated and enlarged from this living space on the southern end of
      the living room. This will probably take the last hope of any summer afternoon
      sun from my yard (forget the winter!)."

      Studios in St Peters. We are a large-scale, multi-disciplinary, artist-run initiative
      that has been in operation for over eight years in the old brick factory at
      31 Princes Highway. \r\n\r\nWe are a platform for over 40 artists and makers,
      we offer studio space to 15 artists and manage a gallery that shows regular
      eclectic and well-attended exhibitions and we are considered a vibrant heart
      to the arts quarter of St Peters. We provide a rich cultural capital to this
      area and are well loved both by local residents, the arts scene, emergent and
      established artists and makers, the wider LGA, as well as being well-supported
      by Council.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to receive anything in the post regarding the
      DA listed above. We are situated next door to this proposed development and
      would be so badly affected we would have to cease operation as we share both
      an internal and external wall with #63 Princes Highway.\r\n\r\nCan you please
      advise the processes required by Council for this situation? We were under the
      understanding that all local business and residents would be notified, and that
      the proposed DA would be displayed (it is not). \r\n\r\nNaturally, we are all
      extremely concerned about this and need to know as soon as possible what is
      going on. I understand none of our neighbours have been notified either. \r\n\r\nThank
      you in advance for your assistance with this matter. \r\n\r\nH Morgan-Harris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      and congestion\r\nThis DA in addition to the 1000 other dwellings unfortunately
      being developed in the area, is creating a gross over development of the quaint
      and historical suburb.\r\nParking is near impossible at the local shopping strip,
      discouraging shopping with small business and public transport is at capacity
      with the current population and cannot withstand an increase.\r\nThis DA only
      favours property developers and not the existing community. Property developers
      are set to make huge financial gains while the local community is left to deal
      with the consequences.\r\n\r\nLoss of heritage and character\r\nDulwich Hill
      is a largely intact 120-year Federation garden suburb.  The very reason why
      the residents love living in this area and why new residents want to move to
      Dulwich Hill is because of the period homes and heritage of the suburb.  Adding
      yet another soul-less building that doesn't respect the local heritage, should
      not be approved.\r\n\r\nStress on infrastructure\r\nCouncil has not made any
      plans for increased and improved infrastructure.  Public transport is at capacity,
      roads cannot cope with additional traffic (and most homes now have two cars,
      where will the additional cars park?), the daycare centres  and preschools have
      waitlists that are years long and schools cannot accept more students. How can
      our suburb cope with yet another apartment block?\r\n\r\nDulwich Hill is being
      negatively subjected to developer greed, with little regard to the exsiting
      community and future consquences.  Does the suburb really need another ugly
      apartment block?  Please do not approve this DA.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nNW"

    text: With all due respect, is it not a little late for Council to be issuing
      a draft traffic report?  The traffic reports really should have been prepared
      before the approved developments have added an extra 1000 odd units into a very
      small area.  The residents of Lewisham St were promised this report a few years
      ago given the narrow street is used as a way to get to Denison and then over
      to the western side of Dulwich Hill. The residents of Dulwich St were led to
      believe this report was due before the development at 429-449 New Canterbury
      Rd was approved.  For this local resident it really seems like a waste of time
      and a very very late box ticking exercise which will only serve to tell us what
      we already know, that the streets of Dulwich Hill are becoming a car park and
      that the situation will only get worse ...

    text: "I object to this proposal on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. Six car spaces
      for fifteen units is simply not enough. With more than 90 units at The Denison,
      246 units at Arlington Grove, 66 in Hill St and now more proposed on this site
      and the corner building opposite, where are all the people going to park? Where
      will their visitors park? No they will not all be using the light rail - such
      a short-sighted assumption.\r\n\r\n2. Where is the additional green space for
      all of these residents? Is boxing people in by concrete really the way forward
      for our city? Johnson Park is already overused.\r\n\r\n3. Dulwich Hill PS is
      already at capacity and Lewisham will be full once all of the current developments
      in the area are finished. Will a new school be built to cater for all the children?\r\n\r\n4.
      Backing up N Hay's comment above, when will the independent traffic study be
      done? How are the residents' concerns being represented?\r\n\r\n5. I live right
      in the firing line of all these developments and things have been unbearable
      lately - both on foot and traffic-wise. I also have grave concerns for pedestrians
      who make their way up the hill on foot towards New Canterbury Rd and have seen
      a number of near misses as cars rush around the roundabout at the corner of
      Denison and Constitution Rd. \r\n\r\nWhat traffic calming strategies are in
      place to protect pedestrians, especially those with small children who cannot
      move as quickly as a single adult? I note there is a brand new childcare centre
      being built on Denison Rd - how will parents safely walk their toddlers and
      babies there with no pedestrian crossings available and no traffic calming devices
      on Constitution? Also seeing as there is the expectation that few of these new
      residents will have cars?\r\n\r\nPlease consider carefully the amenity of the
      area and the safety and well-being of all residents, both current and future.
      I'm not anti-development but there are social aspects to consider that don't
      seem to be given any thought.\r\n\r\n"

      text: "Hi Sue,\n\nThanks for leaving your comments and also sending them directly
        to me.\n\nI understand that parking, traffic and infrastructure are big concerns
        for residents in Marrickville generally, and in the north part of Dulwich
        Hill particularly (which is where I have lived for the majority of my council
        term, also). Council can contribute in some way to new infrastructure, but
        schools etc. are beyond our powers. I have previously advocated for a more
        moderate approach to development in the area, particularly the Grove St development
        and the application for the very large building on the little triangular parcel
        of land on the hill - particularly in light of constraints on open public
        space and local schools.\n\nI've registered an interest in this DA with our
        planning staff, which means I will get to see a draft report before the determination
        is made. I will be able to 'call up' the application to have it determined
        by the full council, if that is not the intent of council officers - although
        I am assuming give the high level of public interest in this application,
        that it will likely be determined by the council in any case. \n\nThe independent
        traffic and parking studies were very recently completed and a draft went
        to today's traffic committee meeting. It will then be considered by council's
        Infrastructure, Planning and Environmental Services Committee on the first
        Tuesday in May. Residents can speak to the report at that meeting. The report
        will then be put on public exhibition and I would encourage you to make comments.
        I've only had a brief chance to read the report so far, but it does recommend
        some traffic calming measures that the community has previously suggested.
        I am very happy to have a meeting with you and your neighbours about the traffic
        and parking reports - on a weekend afternoon is the easiest for me. Please
        let me know if you think this would be useful.\n\nLike you, I am very concerned
        about pedestrian safety in particular, especially with extra vehicle movements
        in the area, and I've had some near misses on foot myself.  While I completely
        agree that development has contributed to this, I do also want to note that
        increased car dependence is also contributing, and this is something we need
        to work together to resolve.\n\nI will be paying close attention to community
        feedback on this DA. You can contact me directly if you'd like more information

      text: "Jennifer,\n\n\nCr Cahill has passed your request for information regarding
        the Cooby Pipeline in the Cawdor Road area on to me.\n\nI am sure you have
        noticed the surveyors in Cawdor/Mitchell Road area recently. They have been
        gathering survey information for a trunk water main extending from the Highfields
        Water Supply pipeline.\n\nThe Highfields Water Supply pipeline supplies water
        from the Mt Kynoch reservoirs to Highfields. The trunk water main is to cater
        for the continuing development of the Highfields /Meringandan area and is
        not related to the development of the Cawdor Road Service station or adjoining
        land.\n\nThere are two trains of thought for the route of this trunk water
        main\n\n  1.  extending along Mitchell Road out to the New England Highway,
        along the Highway to and along Cawdor Road\n  2.  continuing to Cawdor Rd
        in the Cooby Pipeline main easement which is the alignment of the Highfields
        Water Supply pipeline from Mt Kynoch to Mitchell Rd.\n\nEither route will
        of course be in the vicinity of properties in Bernard Court.\n\nWith regard
        to the Cooby pipeline there was discussion had due to concerns about what
        future development may happen on the block of land adjoining the service station
        to the west, not so much the service station itself. This discussion considered
        what options may be available if there were any significant impacts on the
        pipeline. These discussions also considered whether the age and condition
        of the pipeline were an issue and also the continuing development encroachment
        upon the easement for the pipeline.\n\nRelocation of the Cooby pipeline was
        one such option, other options were; is anything required, replacement, refurbishment
        or protection of the section of main through the easement from Bernard Court
        to Cawdor Road.\n\nWhile there has been discussion on options, what may be
        done will be subject to what future development, if any,  happens and timing
        of the development.\n\nIn summary ;\n1. there are currently no plans to realign
        the Cooby pipeline and any future necessary actions will be assessed in line
        with timing of any development in the area.\n2. options for location of the
        trunk water main extending from the Highfields Water Supply Pipeline to Cawdor
        Road are being assessed.\n\nI hope this answers your queries at this time,
        if you require further clarification please contact me as per the details
        below.\n\nRegards\n\nPhil McEwan\nManager\nWater Infrastructure Services\n\nToowoomba

    text: "To councillor Bill Cahill, \r\nI am writing to strongly object to the proposed
      development at 1 Cawdor RD (ref RAL/2016/1776), being a proposed combined MCU
      RAL and OWS Service Station.\r\n Reasons for objections are as follows: \r\n1.
      Cawdor Road runs through a well established residential area, with the road
      and environment not set up to receive the increased traffic, noise and safety
      risks that such a development would create. Introduction of such a commercial
      space would be detrimental to the safe, peaceful, family-oriented residential
      environment currently enjoyed by residents living along and near to Cawdor Road.
      \r\n2. There are already 3 other service station complexes within Highfields,
      two of which are within one kilometer from the proposed site, just a little
      further north along the highway, within the existing commercial zone. There
      is surely no need for another service station on the same side of the highway
      in this small area of the new England Highway. \r\n3. If there IS an identified
      genuine need for a 4th service station, it should be within the existing commercial
      zone, nearer to the two existing service stations (plus cafes and shops) further
      along the New England Highway. Further, another service station would be better
      placed on the opposite side of the highway to the existing service stations.
      It seems that rezoning for this proposal would only suit the interests of the
      developer, with no consideration for the residents of Cawdor Road and surrounding
      streets. \r\nSincerely, \r\nKathryn Weier \r\nCawdor Road Resident "

        Station, Subdivision 1 into 2 lots and 2x Pylon Sign, 2x Ground Sign and 1x
        Roof Sign/Projecting Wall Sign\nLink: https://www.planningalerts.org.au/applications/642887?utm_campaign=view-application&utm_medium=email&utm_source=councillor-notifications\n\nKathryn
        Weier writes:\n\nTo councillor Bill Cahill,\nI am writing to strongly object
        to the proposed development at 1 Cawdor RD (ref RAL/2016/1776), being a proposed
        combined MCU RAL and OWS Service Station.\nReasons for objections are as follows:\n1.
        Cawdor Road runs through a well established residential area, with the road
        and environment not set up to receive the increased traffic, noise and safety
        risks that such a development would create. Introduction of such a commercial
        space would be detrimental to the safe, peaceful, family-oriented residential
        environment currently enjoyed by residents living along and near to Cawdor
        Road.\n2. There are already 3 other service station complexes within Highfields,
        two of which are within one kilometer from the proposed site, just a little
        further north along the highway, within the existing commercial zone. There
        is surely no need for another service station on the same side of the highway
        in this small area of the new England Highway.\n3. If there IS an identified
        genuine need for a 4th service station, it should be within the existing commercial
        zone, nearer to the two existing service stations (plus cafes and shops) further
        along the New England Highway. Further, another service station would be better
        placed on the opposite side of the highway to the existing service stations.
        It seems that rezoning for this proposal would only suit the interests of
        the developer, with no consideration for the residents of Cawdor Road and
        surrounding streets.\nSincerely,\nKathryn Weier\nCawdor Road Resident\n\n=========================================================================\n\nThis

      with the increasing number of developments that continue to impact on the characteristics
      of our neighbourhood. It is important that we continue to respect the tireless
      work of our democratically appointed local Councillors. I have personally had
      dealings with some of our present and past Boroondara Councillors, both commercially
      and as a vocal local resident in different wards. My most recent dealing involved
      discussion with Councillor Heinz Kreutz in a commercial development opportunity.
      I respect the balanced position that Heintz took in considering the impact this
      woukd have on his constituents and believe he is owed the respect as a long
      serving and dedicated Councillor who understands and researches all issues put
      before him. I believe this is true of most, if not all of our Councillors. Let's
      continue to show our respect and band together with them in seeking their support
      for the best outcomes for our municipality. Remember, they are there to serve
      our community and we need their support. Our respect will avoid detracting good
      people into these important roles into the future."

    text: "I received a letter from Boroondara Council this week advising :\r\n\r\n\"The
      fact is that Council is generally only involved with single dwellings where
      the site:\r\n- is in a heritage overlay.\r\n- is subject to flooding, landscape
      or environmental overlays.\r\n- has a land area less than 500 sqm.\r\nThe vast
      majority of residential sites in Boroondara are NOT subject to these controls
      and no planning approval is required from Council for the demolition of an existing
      house and / or the construction of a single house.\r\n...... the vast majority
      of building permits for single dwellings are issued by private building surveyors
      who are not employed by Council and not required to seek Council approval.\r\n......
      Unlike the state's planning regulations, there is also no requirement in the
      building regulations for notification to neighbours of any proposed demolition
      or construction of a new dwelling.\r\n.... Council shares the community's concerns
      that the current regulations are deficient and has been investigating ways to
      address the issue.\"\r\n\r\nI was not aware of the above and the lack of control
      Council have over new houses in Boroondara.\r\n\r\nStarting to make sense why
      house after house are being demolished to make way for McMansions built boundary
      to boundary.\r\n"

    text: "@ Lucy of Camberwell and @ NS Kassy\r\n\r\nThank you for acknowledging
      the surrounding houses (east/west and north) have historical character from
      the 1920s and 30s. The shops in the strip do too. The icecream shop and the
      florist are protected by a heritage overlay. The dental surgery has been reported
      as of individual historical significance.\r\n\r\nWe have an existing supermarket,
      Woolworths, (with permission to develop any time in the future) - why would
      you want the variety of serivces used by the community removed to put a second
      supermarket opposite an existing supermarket taking up the whole block? It would
      make more sense to put in a variety of shops on the subject site. The building
      detail could definitely be improved upon. The proposal could have canopy trees.
      Less 'major shopping centre style' illuminated signage.\r\n\r\nIf you think
      the traffic is a nightmare now, wait until this proposal is built. You will
      definitely go and shop at the Junction because Middle Camberwell will be so
      congested (212 car parks).. There are no traffic signals proposed for the 4
      driveways to Riversdale Rd from the proposed supermarket, so you will have traffic
      turning from both sides of Riversdale Road east and west - accidents waiting
      to happen.\r\n\r\n4 driveways across the footpath is not pedestrian friendly
      - for children, elderly and the rest of the community. Will exiting/entering
      cars in a hurry give way to pedestrians?\r\n\r\nA little more thought should
      be given to the surrounding community when considering this ridiculous proposal,
      those residents who are stuck with it, not just the convenience for 'city workers
      heading home at night to stop and grab a few things'. The residents who live
      here will not be driving through and leaving Middle Camberwell. They are stuck
      with the amenity loss forever."

    text: "@ N S Kassy We are most certainly NOT from Woolworths management.  Your
      comments reek of ignorance.  I wonder if you even live near the proposal or
      will you drive through and back to your amenity.  Have you bothered looking
      at the plans yet?  Have a long hard look at them.  I wouldn't call an art deco
      shopping strip 'ugly'.  It is part of the history of the area.  What will be
      ugly will be the proposal ... if it goes ahead.  It is a long box without character
      and pretty pointless putting another large supermarket opposite Woolworths,
      removing services, like the medical clinic, etc needed in the community.   That
      is not planning for the future.  This is not 'vibrant'.  If you bothered to
      look, you will see this section of Riversdale Road has many 'lovely period homes'
      both east and west of the shopping strip.  If you need a 'big shopping complex'
      you could visit Camberwell Junction, Box Hill or even Chadstone.   FYI this
      is not a 'big shopping complex' it is just a big supermarket, bottleshop and
      car park taking up the whole block."

    text: "Re PP15/01414\r\nDear Sir,\r\nWe wish to object most strongly to the plan
      for a large supermarket in Middle Camberwell.\r\nFirst a general comment and
      complaint: planners seem to be increasingly intent on allowing or encouraging
      development which is quite inappropriate in some areas, and greatly favours
      big Business, often at the detriment of actual people, particularly those who
      live or work in the area.\r\nThis proposed development in Middle Camberwell
      is a very clear case in point. A large company is being allowed to develop an
      area despite strong objection on what seem very sensible grounds by local people,
      including those in the Heritage area bordering it.\r\nThe first, and obvious
      point is that we already have one middle sized supermarket, and there are at
      least 2 more, much larger, about 2 km away, and only a few minutes by car. Other
      serious objections are that the proposed building will dwarf the local heritage
      area, and cause traffic congestion in it, as well as more danger to local walkers
      and children. (This has already occurred to some extent, with recent increase
      in parking in local streets, and also, for example, 'cut through' driving in
      our Griotte/Dorothea street because of increased traffic, particularly after
      hours, some coming from the supermarket. ) There are many walkers, both school
      children with parents, and old slow walking people passing our corner each day.
      There are four large schools in the area, two with primary sections. Several
      of their children walk to and from the tram stop in Middle Camberwell or to
      the nearby railway station.\r\nAnother objection is because of the Riversdale
      Road congestion which is likely to occur. There would be many supply lorries
      for a new store which will be a cause for traffic delays, at times. This is
      already true for the current store, and, at times appears to cause increased
      danger to children congregating on the pavements, both sides between the 7-11
      and the present supermarket. Sometimes, after the close of school in the afternoons,
      I have counted more than 40 children outside the 7-11, waiting for the tram,
      and several more on the opposite side, (most of them cross over with the lights!)
      At present a big group has space to spread out onto the 7-11 verge or apron
      (often having made purchases inside). It is sometimes necessary for pedestrians
      to zig-zag a way through. Mostly if a pram is involved, it gets good consideration.
      But what will happen if we have building walls right out to the edge of the
      narrowish pavement on both sides of the street near the lights and tram stops?
      There will be much less room to accommodate 40 or so children, and also, at
      times, the area will probably act as a 'wind tunnel'\r\nUnfortunately Middle
      Camberwell has never had a 'public area' near the places where people congregate,
      or rest, (unlike Malling Road, for instance), but some sense of visual space
      has been given by the areas much wider that the narrow pavement, such as in
      front of the 7-11, the pet shop, furniture shop and Dry Cleaner. It seems these
      can be taken away from the community.\r\nNot only that, but we seem set to lose
      several small stores and Doctor's rooms, where many work, in favour of a large
      store which is likely to be much automated. In small stores owners are able
      to adapt to their customers' needs, and interact over interests, family, children,
      etc. If the present supermarket is any guide, it will be possible to get goods
      there and not have to interact with a single person. Furthermore, the checkout
      people change, so there is less likely to be the same person to interact with
      next time of checking out. It is often difficult to find someone to help in
      such big stores where the owners' understandable aim is to reduce wages as much
      as possible! Present automation trends suggests that trolleys may be designed
      with loops, which, as goods are dropped into them, will total the cost, so with
      merely a credit card one can walk out of the store to car or home without interacting
      with a single person! We ourselves have already experienced this with hand held
      scanners doing a similar job to a loop.\r\nAnd this when increasing research
      suggests that humans, particularly older people and those living on their own,
      need contact with others to stay mentally healthy. Another reason for serious
      concern over human health in the region is how much increased the pollution
      will be with many heavy diesel lorries and cars coming into it. It is well known
      that slowing and accellerating adds a great deal to the pollution emitted from
      vehicles. This will be greatly to the detriment of those walking and working
      in the area. Automotive pollution is ever more seen as a serious cause of poor
      health, particularly in the aged, of which there are many in the surrounding
      areas, many having to walk to and from home to the shops, or children walking
      to and from schools.\r\nThis is not a case of NIMBY, because development is
      welcome, if in keeping with an area, and helps local residents to have more
      fulfilling lives instead of more automation.\r\nYour concerned residents"

    text: "I am concerned about this application because I feel due to the historical
      significance of this building that any developer with any plans should be transparent
      and say they intend to make alterations to the \"Old Marrickville Fire Station\".
      \r\n\r\n#1 Assessment of significance: The building remains intact and retains
      its integrity.\r\n\r\nA prominent building on Stanmore Road, the Fire Station
      is closely associated with the civic and retail centre which developed around
      the intersection of Stanmore Road and New Canterbury Road in the 1880's. It
      reflects the establishment of the Fire Brigades Board of Sydney in 1884. \r\n\r\nSo
      with this in mind, if alterations can help maintain the current building and
      foster a civic and retail zone in that area then I support the application but
      under the proviso that none of the significant features are removed including
      (but not limited to as little information has been provided in application esp
      about present condition inside & out);\r\n• rendered facade with simple raised
      detailing to the windows\r\n• heavy quoins and keystones to the doors\r\n• raised
      triangular pediment to one end \r\n• gable parapet to the other\r\n• Pressed
      metal ceilings \r\n• concertina timber doors.\r\n\r\nAny developer must be fully
      aware of the historical significance of this building so the plans they present
      should embrace this and no plans should ever be approved unless they contribute
      in maintaining all original features.\r\n\r\nFurther info;\r\nhttp://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2030095\r\n\r\nhttp://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2030095"

    text: It is hard to find all the details of the signage planned, however looking
      at existing Liquorland stores  (which we presume the signage is for),  would
      be totally unacceptable in this area.  This shopping strip is known for it's
      "village" atmosphere and low key shop fronts.  The proposed signage would be
      totally out of character and would dominate this lovely area which we hope to
      preserve.

      local community are concerned about with this sub division so close to rural
      living. My wife and myself have concerns as we wil back straight on to this
      sub division and if, in the future the buffer zone is removed, which is in place
      already, It will give us up to 6 house's on our back boundary and that's not
      why we decided to build and live in Cotswold Hills some 15 years ago. Our views
      will be taken away and replaced with a sea of roofs. We are also worried about
      the crime rate going up in the area. This is a peaceful community we live in.
      \ I understand that it is a growing community but really the size of the blocks
      these people and you the council may approve is a discuss. You just have to
      look at the sub division that is in Nugget Pinch Rd, It has been going on for
      quite a few years now. Just like to know what will bring people to live in Toowoomba

    text: I have done a similar subdivision across the road from this address, on
      a similar size block and in the interests of the neighbourhood have opted to
      make both lots of a similar size over 500 sq metres each. How could council
      allow a 3 bedroom home to sit on such a small block of 261 sq metres? This tiny
      block will be a permanent blight with footpath and  front-yard car parking only.
      This needs to be reassessed. No wonder it is currently being advertised as "the
      cheapest house in Toowoomba".  For Paul Antonio and Bill Cahill's attention.

    text: "Ridiculous. A medical centre with reduction of parking in this location!
      \r\nWhat will it be a drive through medical centre?\r\nHave any councillors
      or planners recently attended medical facilities in Cambewell to see how well
      used the car parks are? By the nature of medical facilities ii is not always
      the most able bodied in our community using them. Parents with sick children,
      the elderly, sporting injuries etc cannot hop on a tram to access the centre.
      Adequate parking for staff and clients coming and going is a necessity. Remember
      with appointments, you have one person waiting, one person with professional
      and one person leaving to also add to the impact, this is without considering
      backlog if an appointment takes longer than allotted time. \r\nCouncil parking
      with restricted times is of no use for medical appointments.\r\nI am not against
      all development I am for good planning with adequate infrastructure, such as
      parking. Almost every development we see come through asks for a reduction in
      car parking, yet we are not seeing a reduction of cars in our community. We
      need to provide minimum parking for all new developments to stop the choking
      of our roads further. Cars propped on major roads waiting for car parks or queuing
      to get into minimal council car parking at peak times, is only going to get
      worse. These are MINIMUM requirements that people keep appealing against. "

    text: "This development is not in keeping with the streetscape nor the cadastral
      patten of properties in the street. This Section of Warren road is of historical,
      social and architectural interest to the state of NSW. It remains as assessed
      in the Marrickville heritage study of 1986. For example Joe Cahill ( the Cahill
      express was named after him) was raised in this street and many contributors
      to Sydney's public service and business have lived here. Not to mention the
      historic and heritage church with and parish house nearby. \r\nThe street demographic
      comprises families, elderly and low cost housing. As one resident said- it is
      a lovely street with lovely people and should remain as it is. \r\nThe house
      at number 27 Warren road is a largely intact Italianate building with original
      features. All through the development application the owner/applicant derided
      both the street and the house. The signage for publication of the DA was between
      30 December 2015 and 26 January 2016, right in the middle of the holiday period
      and the public notification sign was not visible for days during this period.
      Many people who live in close proximity to this property also state that they
      did not get a notification letter so as to respond to this development application
      and were dismayed. \r\nAll in all it is a shame to increase the congestion and
      reduce the amenity for this already crowded and busy street, for the local hardworking
      community that resides here in Warren road. \r\nAs a local resident I am aware
      that all of the houses remain largely intact inside and out. The street attracts
      visitors and artists from all walks of life, young renters like the street for
      its historical charm and there are people who have been here for over 50 years.
      The development proposed at number 27 is not instep with the NSW state government
      plan nor local zoning rules,this part of Warren road is meant to be low rise/
      low density accommodation. To put 3 three bedroom houses with basement house
      and carports and paved courtyards on one plot is overcrowding and insensitive
      to the area and local residents. \r\nThis house is now being renovated for the
      purposes of a boarding house and it is clear that there has been no development
      application for such a purpose. Council needs to look into the actions of the
      developer. If the house is ruined from the inside will this affect councils
      assessment of this property because the applicant had stated incorrectly that
      there were little or no original features to this Italianate property?"

      and states he intends to make the house into a boarding house. This is before
      the original DA has been assessed. There has been no planning permission sought
      for a boarding house in the initial DA. A reference to low cost accommodation
      in the DA is not the same as a boarding house DA.\r\nI was dismayed to see workman
      come to the house on 9 February with sledge hammers, parking illegally on the
      street and doing some kind of renovation. \r\nThe owner if he is to make a boarding
      house of this property needs to make another DA.\r\nWarren road between Illawarra
      and Livingstone roads has upwards of 4 rooming and boarding houses at present
      maybe more- as well as other low cost housing and apartments. The accommodation
      at number 27 Warren road requires major renovations to comply with a boarding
      house development. Council should investigate the developers intentions and
      actions."

      Rd where a significant heritage building was demolished (construction on this
      very dangerous corner continues), reduced parking was also sought and won, again.
      But the council fought hard to stop this, VCAT were the agency who allowed it
      to happen with scant regard to the heritage status the building had secured
      decades ago, little regard for parking issues and traffic dangers on that corner
      not to mention amenity and character loss. VCAT also need to take a long hard
      look at themselves and ask if they are acting truly impartially.

      As a resident of 30 years it has been very concerning and upsetting to see the

      This is why I chose to live in this area however I have been very disappointed
      by the decisions made by the Boroondara Council in relation to the very ugly
      overdevelopment of this area. It has also been distressing watching over the
      years the total disregard for beautiful facade of the once SSB bank. This is
      part of our heritage and should be retained. This is what people want to see
      when they travel the world the beautiful ornate architecture of the past. Imagine
      if the Colosseum in Rome had been allowed to be pulled down. What would we know
      of the past. Stop over developing the Burke Rd area which is becoming unattractive,
      congested and ugly. Protect our heritage. Be responsible not greedy.

      have allowed to deteriorate over time, is an act of vandalism. Why do we have
      Heritage Overlays and standards when the council is not prepared to enforce

      This is the most historic, decorative and beautiful façade in the whole of the
      Camberwell Junction shopping precinct. If the owners are not prepared to look
      after these structures then a law ought to be introduced to force them to sell

      application to develop 59 dwellings and reduce standard car parking requirements

      is a vast over development which will overshadow and overlook residential housing

      all the time. Developers ought to be required to provide the required parking

      Reduction of the required parking and loading bay requirements ought to be denied.
      The explosion in huge developments in the Hawthorn, Camberwell area has led
      to a great increase in traffic.  There are also delays and detours with roads
      closed and hold ups for cranes, trucks and other requirements when developers

    text: "As a long-time resident abutting Fahey Lane which will suffer some of the
      immediate brunt of this development, I am simultaneously shocked and unsurprised
      that Marrickville Council did not notify me of this DA. It appears that it only
      notified 3 properties within 5m of the development, rather than the larger range
      of residents who will be affected daily by this development. It also snuck the
      comment period into the middle of the country's main vacation period just to
      make review less possible.\r\n\r\nEven the small development at the other end
      of Fahey Lane has already cost residents three street parking spots. That's
      not taking into account many more lost during the year or so of construction
      due to builders' vehicles on-site during the day, and left on Perry St on the
      weekends. \r\n\r\nWe already have a situation where new developments have increased
      the local parking burden, yet Marrickville Council repeatedly rejects requests
      to implement parking schemes. Even the simple option of making the eastern side
      of Perry St between Brown St and Addison Rd rear to kerb parking as it is between
      Brown and Cowper is too much for the Council to contemplate. With the other
      developments on Addison Road and Cowper St, the population of this area of Marrickville
      is set to DOUBLE in a couple of years. The council should be engaging with residents
      IN ADVANCE of this rather than dribbling out uncontestable developments in a
      small radius.\r\n\r\nAny development abutting Fahey Lane has shown that it blocks
      resident access to their garages, and makes garbage collection almost impossible.
      I am increasing having to call the council to reattempt collection because construction
      fencing or vehicles blocked the lane. I've also witnessed Marrickville Council
      garbage trucks backing at great speed down the Lane (knocking over bins everywhere)
      because through transit is not possible. The Lane is narrow enough as it is
      that I've had my vehicle damaged by a garbage truck and have essentially given
      up after a year of contacting a very evasive council to pay costs.\r\n\r\nTo
      underline comments above, even the building period removes substantial access
      and parking opportunities in this area. So if the council is waiting 1-2 years
      for development to complete to sort things out then it is waaaay too late. We
      still haven't caught up on the issues caused by the last 3 developments. The
      local real estate agent has up to five vehicles taking up street parking (often
      one vehicle taking two spaces) all the time. We are also seeing people leave
      their cars here all day (or for a couple of weeks) to get a shorter bus commute
      to the city or taxi to airport.\r\n\r\nI've gone from being able to park quite
      close to my house to having to hunt through surrounding streets. Unfortunately
      I'm much older and my back is less up to carrying shopping that far, so the
      council may be forcing a disabled zone outside my house.\r\n\r\nIn respect of
      the building, it is of a completely inappropriate architectural character for
      the area. This is a vibrant historical precinct which could be developed into
      a mixed residential/retail/production area with greater sympathy for the surrounds
      (which I welcome) than dropping an ugly business park monolith into the streetscape.
      The height of the building will not only have shadowing effects on Addison Road,
      but noise from low aeroplanes bounces around off taller buildings in this area.
      The fact that it sits adjacent to single-storey residences makes me wonder if
      someone is trying to put the Pixar movie \"Up\" into reality. \r\n\r\nIn respect
      of the property purpose, I agree with the above comments that any short-term
      residential development of this nature from this particular developer is not
      to be trusted. The noise disturbances and vandalism generated by his backpacker
      residents has long been an issue for people living near these properties. Marrickville
      Police will testify to this.\r\n\r\nLastly the traffic added to this intersection
      is not sustainable. Exiting to Addison Road from side streets is extremely difficult
      due to poor visibility. Addison Road is frequently gridlocked on weekends due
      to short traffic lights at Stanmore Road/Enmore Road intersection which causes
      traffic to back up past Enmore Park heading south, and west to Illawarra Rd
      on Addison. The increasing popularity of the Addison Road markets compounds
      this issue: parallel-parking with no marked bays on side streets means there
      is no maximum utilisation of space, and this encourages double-parking, parking
      across home garage entrances etc. \r\n\r\n(All of this is adding up to very
      good reasons to support Marrickville Council being amalgamated into a hopefully
      more professional and responsive larger organisation. It has proved ineffective
      in being either on these issues for years now.)\r\n"

    text: "Another important fact that Marrickville Council should check is the amount
      of times that Marrickville police have been called over the past 10 years or
      more due to  noise disturbance to the local community from the property Mr Perry
      owns and  did rent until recently  to Backpackers in Newington Mews just around
      the corner from this proposed property.\r\n\r\nIf we have laws making pubs close
      at 10pm because of the noise factor to the neighbourhood why would council approve
      a development like Mr Perry has in mind when his past  history of developments
      creating  such on going disturbance to the community because the backpackers
      he rents his properties to.\r\n\r\n"

    text: "\r\nI strongly object to Mr Perry's development. I live around the corner
      from the Townhouses  in Newington Mews that Mr Perry rented to back packers
      for a number of years. Mr Perry was  made to stop renting these townhouses to
      back packers only last October, these town houses were never legally meant for
      backpackers but Mr Perry did anyway.  It took years to bring Mr Perry to justice
      and stop advising these townhouses to backpackers for rent. For years the local
      residents put up with all night parties, the town houses were destroyed, leaving
      the immediate area looking like a dump. If Mr Perry repeats the same intent
      with this development we will have only just moved the issue of noise and destruction
      from one corner of Marrickville to the other.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing positive
      about this development for the community at all nothing.\r\n "

    text: "I'd like to strongly object to this DA.  The parking situation and traffic
      congestion on Addison Road is already at an unmanageable level.  A motel development
      will by definition attract travellers with motor vehicles and any additional
      demand on the street is unwelcome and unreasonable.  The DA mentions trains
      stations that are close by but this is simply untrue - Marrickville and Newtown
      stations are a significant distance and guests would not be using trains as
      public transport (especially with luggage).  \r\n\r\nIn addition I disagree
      with the idea that there is a community need for Motel accommodation in this
      area.  There is already a backpackers on Addison Road as well as several cheap
      accommodation options at nearby pub's.  What is in need in this area is a higher
      standard hotel however this development does not meet this need.  I worry about
      the management and upkeep of this establishment based on the reputation of the
      applicant company.\r\n\r\nI also think the aesthetic design of this building,
      especially at street level, is at odds with the character of the area.  \r\n\r\nMarrickville
      Council needs to put in place a short / medium and long term plan for the Addison
      Road precinct - including a residential parking scheme for Addison Road and
      surrounds.  There is a large number of developments currently underway and they
      will accumulatively have a significant impact on this road.  There is potential
      for this to be a vibrant precinct however what is needed is some considered
      forward thinking to ensure that the area is developed in a way that adds to
      it's character and truly meets the needs of the community."

    text: Those of us who already live on Addison Rd are constantly looking for a
      parking spot, often encroaching onto the side streets. This development will
      add to these pressures. Please reconsider the lack of parking spots that will
      be available in the current plan.

    text: "I object to this application. Parking is one issue, the potential for late
      night noise for current residents is another.\r\nI wonder at the motivation
      of people who consider a motel a great addition to the area - how will this
      type of accommodation contribute to the community? By definition, motel residents
      are transient. \r\nAre there conditions that would ensure that the number of
      people occupying each room complies with fire safety and other standards?\r\nHas
      the developer considered the implications of the high ANEF?\r\n\"Street level

    text: Perry Properties have shown a  total disregard for the residents of this
      area in the way they have let and managed their other properties. This seems
      like a cheap back[packer addition rather than a residential development that
      will add value to the community. Parking is now impossible and we have seen
      no holistic plan for the precinct. I object to this proposal because it is a
      "motel" meaning a backpacker doss house. I would support a residential development
      that  attracted home makers who enhanced the community rather than detracted
      from it.

    text: "I am disappointed that developers continue to take advantage of the planning
      concessions available for the creation of affordable housing when all that is
      really being created are stuffy apartment blocks leased under the guise of affordable
      housing.  \r\n\r\nThis property currently constitutes a single dwelling lot,
      yet the developer hopes to convert this into a property consisting of 15 separate
      dwellings.  The developer has defined no plan on how the impact of the increase
      of residents in the area will be alleviated.\r\n\r\nIt is also further disappointing
      that the character of the Marrickville Council area is going to continue to
      be defined by the rise of these high-density developments, which offer no sympathy
      for the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood and contribute little
      to the surrounding community in the same capacity that it contributes to the
      coffers of the council treasury and ultimately the developer's pockets.\r\n\r\nI
      strongly oppose the development of this boarding house on the following grounds:\r\n
      - it detracts from the character of the neighborhood and is not in keeping with
      the style and scope of neighbouring properties.\r\n - the property is an over-development
      and no plans to alleviate the impact of an additional 14 dwellings in the same
      locality have been provided by the developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
